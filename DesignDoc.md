## Step 1: Collect and Prepare Your Documents
Start by collecting or scraping documents relevant to your chatbot (e.g., service manuals, technical bulletins, FAQs). These documents will form your knowledge base.

**Instructions:**

1. Scrape Documents:

    Use tools like BeautifulSoup (Python library) to scrape service bulletins or manuals from websites.
    Alternatively, download PDF or HTML files if the documents are already available.
    Store these documents in a structured format (e.g., text files, JSON, or CSV).

2. Clean and Organize Data:

    Remove unnecessary HTML tags, headers, or footers.
    Break down large documents into smaller chunks (e.g., 200-500 words) for better retrievability.

3. Metadata Extraction:

    Attach metadata to each document or chunk, such as:
    - Title
    - URL (link to the original source)
    - Category (e.g., brakes, engine, transmission).

4. Format Example:

```json
{
  "content": "Grinding noise while braking is caused by worn-out brake pads...",
  "title": "Braking Issues",
  "url": "https://example.com/braking-issues",
  "category": "Brakes"
}
```

## Step 2: Embed Your Documents
Convert your documents into vector embeddings so the chatbot can retrieve relevant chunks based on user queries.

**Instructions:**

1. Choose an Embedding Model:

    Use pre-trained models like OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 (for high-quality embeddings) or open-source alternatives like sentence-transformers.

2. Generate Embeddings:

    For each document chunk, generate a vector embedding.
    Use Python libraries like openai, sentence-transformers, or Hugging Face.

3. Store Embeddings:

    Save embeddings along with metadata in a vector database.

## Step 3: Set Up a Vector Database
A vector database will store and retrieve embeddings when the user asks a question.

**Instructions:**

1. Choose a Database:

    Use cloud-hosted solutions like Pinecone for simplicity.
    For open-source alternatives, try Weaviate, Qdrant, or Milvus.

2. Upload Data:

    Push your embeddings and metadata into the database.

3. Indexing:

    Ensure the database is configured to efficiently retrieve the top-N most relevant documents based on cosine similarity.

## Step 4: Implement the Retrieval-Augmented Generation Pipeline
Set up the retrieval and response generation flow.

**Instructions:**

1. Install Required Libraries:

    Install tools like langchain or haystack to streamline the RAG pipeline.
    Example: pip install langchain openai pinecone-client

2. Build the Pipeline:

    - Retriever:
        - Query the vector database to retrieve the top relevant documents for a user query.
    - Generator:
        - Use a language model (e.g., GPT-4) to combine the retrieved documents and generate a conversational response.

3. Code Example (Using LangChain):

```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.vectorstores import Pinecone
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
import pinecone

# Initialize Pinecone
pinecone.init(api_key="your-pinecone-api-key", environment="your-environment")
vector_store = Pinecone(index_name="mechanic-chatbot", embedding_model="openai-embedding")

# Set up retriever
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_type="similarity", search_k=3)

# Set up language model
llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0)

# Create QA pipeline
qa_pipeline = RetrievalQA(llm=llm, retriever=retriever)

# Ask a question
query = "Why does my car make a grinding noise when braking?"
response = qa_pipeline.run(query)
print(response)
```

## Step 5: Deploy Your Chatbot
Once your pipeline is working, deploy it as a chatbot.

**Instructions:**

1. Frontend Integration:

    Build a chatbot interface using frameworks like Streamlit, Flask, or React.
    Use APIs to send user questions to your RAG pipeline and display responses.

2. Hosting:

    Deploy your chatbot on a cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.
    Use containerization tools like Docker for ease of deployment.

## Step 6: Test and Improve
After deployment, iteratively improve your chatbot.

**Instructions:**

1. Test the Chatbot:

    Verify the chatbot’s ability to retrieve relevant links and provide accurate answers.
    Test with a variety of user queries.

2. Enhance Retrieval:

    Fine-tune your retriever’s parameters (e.g., search_k).
    Add more metadata or adjust chunk sizes for better results.

3. Update Knowledge Base:

    Regularly add new documents or service bulletins to your vector database.

4. Monitor and Log:

    Log user interactions to identify common questions and improve the system.

**Summary of Steps**

1. Scrape and Prepare Documents:

    Collect service bulletins and clean the data.
Generate Embeddings:
    Convert document chunks into vector embeddings.

2. Set Up Vector Database:

    Store embeddings and metadata in a database like Pinecone or Weaviate.

3. Implement RAG Pipeline:

    Use a retriever and GPT-4 to generate responses.

4. Deploy the Chatbot:

    Build a user interface and host the chatbot.

5. Iterate:

    Test, improve, and update your knowledge base.


## Improvements to make:
1. Provide a Custom “No Direct Answer” Prompt
By default, LangChain’s ConversationalRetrievalChain or “stuff” chain might produce “I’m sorry, I don’t know that.” if the LLM can’t confidently answer. But you can override the default prompt to instruct the model to:

Acknowledge it does not have a definitive answer.
Present possibly related sources.
Include disclaimers—e.g. “This may not address your exact problem.”
