## Step 1: Collect and Prepare Your Documents
Start by collecting or scraping documents relevant to your chatbot (e.g., service manuals, technical bulletins, FAQs). These documents will form your knowledge base.

**Instructions:**

1. Scrape Documents:

    Use tools like BeautifulSoup (Python library) to scrape service bulletins or manuals from websites.
    Alternatively, download PDF or HTML files if the documents are already available.
    Store these documents in a structured format (e.g., text files, JSON, or CSV).

2. Clean and Organize Data:

    Remove unnecessary HTML tags, headers, or footers.
    Break down large documents into smaller chunks (e.g., 200-500 words) for better retrievability.

3. Metadata Extraction:

    Attach metadata to each document or chunk, such as:
    - Title
    - URL (link to the original source)
    - Category (e.g., brakes, engine, transmission).

4. Format Example:

```json
{
  "content": "Grinding noise while braking is caused by worn-out brake pads...",
  "title": "Braking Issues",
  "url": "https://example.com/braking-issues",
  "category": "Brakes"
}
```

## Step 2: Embed Your Documents
Convert your documents into vector embeddings so the chatbot can retrieve relevant chunks based on user queries.

**Instructions:**

1. Choose an Embedding Model:

    Use pre-trained models like OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 (for high-quality embeddings) or open-source alternatives like sentence-transformers.

2. Generate Embeddings:

    For each document chunk, generate a vector embedding.
    Use Python libraries like openai, sentence-transformers, or Hugging Face.

3. Store Embeddings:

    Save embeddings along with metadata in a vector database.

## Step 3: Set Up a Vector Database
A vector database will store and retrieve embeddings when the user asks a question.

**Instructions:**

1. Choose a Database:

    Use cloud-hosted solutions like Pinecone for simplicity.
    For open-source alternatives, try Weaviate, Qdrant, or Milvus.

2. Upload Data:

    Push your embeddings and metadata into the database.

3. Indexing:

    Ensure the database is configured to efficiently retrieve the top-N most relevant documents based on cosine similarity.

## Step 4: Implement the Retrieval-Augmented Generation Pipeline
Set up the retrieval and response generation flow.

**Instructions:**

1. Install Required Libraries:

    Install tools like langchain or haystack to streamline the RAG pipeline.
    Example: pip install langchain openai pinecone-client

2. Build the Pipeline:

    - Retriever:
        - Query the vector database to retrieve the top relevant documents for a user query.
    - Generator:
        - Use a language model (e.g., GPT-4) to combine the retrieved documents and generate a conversational response.

3. Code Example (Using LangChain):

```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.vectorstores import Pinecone
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
import pinecone

# Initialize Pinecone
pinecone.init(api_key="your-pinecone-api-key", environment="your-environment")
vector_store = Pinecone(index_name="mechanic-chatbot", embedding_model="openai-embedding")

# Set up retriever
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_type="similarity", search_k=3)

# Set up language model
llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0)

# Create QA pipeline
qa_pipeline = RetrievalQA(llm=llm, retriever=retriever)

# Ask a question
query = "Why does my car make a grinding noise when braking?"
response = qa_pipeline.run(query)
print(response)
```

## Step 5: Deploy Your Chatbot
Once your pipeline is working, deploy it as a chatbot.

**Instructions:**

1. Frontend Integration:

    Build a chatbot interface using frameworks like Streamlit, Flask, or React.
    Use APIs to send user questions to your RAG pipeline and display responses.

2. Hosting:

    Deploy your chatbot on a cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.
    Use containerization tools like Docker for ease of deployment.

## Step 6: Test and Improve
After deployment, iteratively improve your chatbot.

**Instructions:**

1. Test the Chatbot:

    Verify the chatbot’s ability to retrieve relevant links and provide accurate answers.
    Test with a variety of user queries.

2. Enhance Retrieval:

    Fine-tune your retriever’s parameters (e.g., search_k).
    Add more metadata or adjust chunk sizes for better results.

3. Update Knowledge Base:

    Regularly add new documents or service bulletins to your vector database.

4. Monitor and Log:

    Log user interactions to identify common questions and improve the system.

**Summary of Steps**

1. Scrape and Prepare Documents:

    Collect service bulletins and clean the data.
Generate Embeddings:
    Convert document chunks into vector embeddings.

2. Set Up Vector Database:

    Store embeddings and metadata in a database like Pinecone or Weaviate.

3. Implement RAG Pipeline:

    Use a retriever and GPT-4 to generate responses.

4. Deploy the Chatbot:

    Build a user interface and host the chatbot.

5. Iterate:

    Test, improve, and update your knowledge base.

#### The cause of this is that only the `description` field is transformed into embedding. The information such as Make, ModelYear, and type are not part of the retrieval pipeline. To address this problem:

1. Try build the pipeline where the chatbot first collect these information, then use filter when retrieve from the database
2. If the above does not work, try include those information as part of the description.
