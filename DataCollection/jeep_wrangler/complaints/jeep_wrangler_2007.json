        "summary": "I bought my 2007 Jeep Wrangler in November 2020.  It had approximately 122,000 miles on it and has the 6 speed manual transmission.   After driving it for 7 days, I was backing out of a parking spot and heard a loud squeal and was unable to shift gears.  It had to have the clutch replaced along with the flywheel and several other clutch associated parts.  The total was $1,600.  The salesman at the dealership where I bought it told me as I was buying it that there is no warranty  but if something happens in the first couple of weeks that he would work with us.  Of course he did NOT help me.  He wouldn't even return my phone calls.   Whatever, buyer beware!     Second issue is of course the fuel spit back problem.   Every time I fill up, I end up with gas on the Jeep and on the ground.   I love wasting money like that.  There is apparently a recall on this issue but your website says my vehicle has no recalls.  Third issue is all the door hinges are rusting really bad.   I saw that there were several service bulletins on the proper procedures for replacing those hinges.   Those should be replaced by the dealer at no cost.",

THERE IS NO BINDING APPARENT FROM ANY OF THE DUST BOOTS ON THE SHIFTER LEVER. I HAVE HAD THIS VEHICLE SINCE LATE 2009. IT WAS STORED FOR A YEAR AND ONLY DRIVEN MONTHLY FOR SHORT PERIODS. UPON RETURN FROM MY DEPLOYMENT I DROVE THIS VEHICLE AS MY DAILY DRIVER UP TO CURRENT. THE HOTTER THE WEATHER, THE MORE THE TRANSMISSION POPS OUT OF GEAR. EVER SINCE I'VE HAD THE VEHICLE, IT HAS HAD THIS ISSUE.  IT VIOLENTLY POPS OUT IF FIRST GEAR 1 TO 2 TIMES A WEEK; OCCASIONALLY MORE. IT IS NOW BECOMING MORE APPARENT THAT THIS IS A VERY UNSAFE ISSUE. RECENTLY, WHEN TRYING TO MAKE LEFT HAND TURNS ACROSS TRAFFIC, IT WOULD POP OUT OF GEAR AND I WOULD QUICKLY HAVE TO RECOVER AND GET IT BACK INTO GEAR BEFORE ONCOMING TRAFFIC APPROACHED. I HAVE SEEN HUNDREDS OF BLOGS AND INTERNET POSTS STATING THE SAME EXACT ISSUE STATED BY HUNDREDS, IF NOT THOUSANDS OF OTHER JEEP OWNERS OF SIMILAR YEARS AND REFERENCING HAVING TO CHANGE OUT 1 AND 2 GEAR SYNCHROS ACCORDING TO A JEEP BULLETIN. SO, IF JEEP KNOWS IT IS A MAJOR ISSUE, THEN WHY ISN'T THERE A RECALL? OTHERS WERE LUCKY TO GET REPAIRS FOR FREE UNDER WARRANTY, BUT THE MAJORITY OF OWNERS WERE OUT OF WARRANTY, SIMILAR TO ME. SINCE THIS IS SUCH A PREDOMINANT MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE, THEN THIS IS CLEARLY A NEED FOR A RECALL FOR THOSE THAT NEED/REQUIRE THE REPAIR. HISTORY WISE, I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN NOVEMBER 2009 WITH 15703 MILES ON IT. BY APPROX. FEBRUARY 2011 WHEN I STARTED DRIVING IT DAILY AND AT ABOUT 17000 MILES THE ISSUE STARTED. THE VEHICLE CURRENTLY HAS ABOUT 89800 MILES ON IT.",

THE JEEP OWNERS COMMUNITY NAMED IT THE DEATH WOBBLE BECAUSE IT LITERALLY WOBBLES AND SHAKES WITHOUT ANY WARNING LIGHTS, WITHOUT ANYTHING TRIGGERING IT, ON EVERY TYPE OF ROAD, AND AT EVERY SPEED. AFTER IT HAPPENED ON THE INTERSTATE WITH MY SON IN THE CAR WITH ME, I NO LONGER ALLOWED MY CHILDREN TO RIDE IN THE JEEP AT ALL.

THE JEEP DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPT SAID THERE'S NOTHING THAT THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT AND THAT IT WAS VERY COMMON.  HOW IS SUCH A DANGER COMMON??? HOW CAN THESE VEHICLES BE LEGALLY SOLD??

I ALMOST HIT A NEARBY CAR BUT WAS ABLE TO PULL THE CAR INTO AN OPPOSITE PARKING SPACE AND THE CURB HELPED ME STOP THE CAR.  I HAD BEEN DRIVING THE CAR THE DAY BEFORE WITHOUT ANY INDICATION OF A PROBLEM.  I WAS ABLE TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO A NEARBY REPAIR CENTER.    THE MECHANIC CALLED ME TO EXPLAIN THAT THE BRAKE CABLE HAD CORRODED AND THAT THIS WAS THE SECOND OLDER JEEP THAT HE HAD SEEN WITH THIS PROBLEM.  HE SUGGESTED THAT I NOTIFY YOU TO REPORT THIS ISSUE.      I'M COUNTING MY BLESSINGS THAT THIS HAPPENED IN MY PARKING LOT AND NOT A FEW MINUTES LATER WHEN I WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAVELING ON THE INTERSTATE AT 70 MPH.      THE TOTAL COST OF MY REPAIR WAS $446 BECAUSE THE BRAKE SYSTEM HAS BEEN REDESIGNED ACCORDING TO THE MECHANIC.  IT IS MY HOPE THAT ENOUGH OF THESE PROBLEMS WILL BE REPORTED AND THAT JEEP WILL CONDUCT A SAFETY RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM.  I AM ATTACHING A PICTURE OF MY DRIVER'S SIDE BRAKE AND ALSO A COPY OF MY REPAIR BILL.    PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED FURTHER INFORMATION OR WHAT STEPS I CAN TAKE TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE ELSE WILL HAVE THIS POTENTIAL FAILURE OF THEIR BRAKES CAUSING A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.

        "summary": "I BOUGHT A USED 2007 JEEP WRANGLER 2 DR, 4X4 SOFT TOP, IN OCT 20014. IT HAD 82,000 MILES. I HAD NO PREVIOUS BUYING ON THIS MODEL. I  DRIVE MOSTLY HIGHWAY MILES IN NORTH EAST OHIO. I DRIVE ALMOST 90 MILES, ROUND TRIP, PER WORK WEEK. I NOTICED A SLIGHT BOUNCE IN THE FRONT END, SUSPENSION DURING HIGHWAY POSTED SPEEDS OF 65 MILES PER HOUR. I CHANGED THE THE SHOCKS 4 EA.AFTER MY FRONT STRAIGHT  AXIAL BEGAN TO BOUNCE UP AND DOWN, WELL THE BOUNCE WAS WORSE, AFTER A SHORT PERIOD OF TRYING TO HANDLE ROAD CONDITION, EVEN CHANGING ROUTE, TO AVOID THE BOUNCE, AT HIGHWAY SPEED 60 MILES AND UNDER, IT WAS COLD OUT 40 DEGREES, HEAVY TRAFFIC CHRISTMAS TIME, RUSH HOUR, MY JEEP WENT INTO A RADICAL BOUNCE CALLED \" DEATH WOBBLE \" AS NOTED IN THE JEEP WORLD, NOT NOTED BY JEEP, I HAD THREE, IN THE ROW, ONE WORSE, THAN THE ONE BEFORE. THE BOUNCING CAUSED A TRANSMISSION COOLING LINE TO DIS-LARGE, FROM A SITED COUPLING, TO THE ENGINE RADIATER. THE LOSE OF 4 QUARTS OF TRANSMISSION FLUID TO SPILL ON THE 5 LANE HIGHWAY. I NOTICED A LOSE IN SPEED, SMOKE AND RPM ADVANCE, FROM 1800 TO 4000 RPMS IN LESS THAN A MINUTE. NOW I HAD TO NAVIGATE MY WAY THROUGH 4 LANES OF HEAVY 60 MILES TO 75 MILE AN HOUR TRAFFIC, WITH OUT GETTING HIT. WITHIN TWO MILES I MANAGED TO PULL OVER TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER. I HAD A FLASHLIGHT, I LEFT THE ENGINE RUNNING, BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING DARK OUT, I WENT UP FRONT AND LOOKED AT THE FRONT END AND SAW TRANSMISSION FLUID. I SHUT OFF THE ENGINE, AND CALLED FOR A TOW. 2 HOURS LATER, PLUS 77.00 DOLLARS, I WENT HOME. I LIVE ON A BUDGET. I WROTE JEEP, BUT WITHOUT A WORD, FROM THEM. SO I LOOKED AT MY OWNERS MANUAL, AND SAW NOTHING ABOUT CHANGING SHOCKS, COIL SPRINGS AT MILES MAINTENANCE SERVICE INTERVALS. I NOTICED YOUR NAME, SO I CONTACTED YOU FOR HELP. LUCKILY I WASN'T HIT OR WORSE. I'M 62 YEARS YOUNG, AND HAVE DRIVING EXPERIENCE. I HOPE THIS HELPS.",

THE BACK UP PLACE STARTED THEIR INSPECTION OF PROBLEM AND NOTICED THE STABILIZER WAS FAULTY AND HE STARTED WITH REPLACING THAT AGAIN.  I GOT THE JEEP BACK TO ONLY FIND IT WAS STILL NOT FIXED.

I CHECKED THE OIL AND IT WAS LOW. I TOOK IT TO A LOCAL SHOP(VALVOLINE QUICK LUBE) TO GET AN OIL CHANGE AND THEY MENTIONED THE OIL PLUG WAS STRIPPED AND THAT THERE WAS SILICONE CAULK TO HELP SEAL THE OIL PLUG. AT THIS POINT I HAD THEM REPLACE THE OIL PLUG AND WAS CONTENT WITH THE SERVICE. AFTER DRIVING 500-600 MILES AFTER THE OIL CHANGE I CHECKED THE OIL AND IT WAS LOW AS IF IT WAS DISAPPEARING. NO VISIBLE LEAKS IN MY GARAGE AND NONE IN MY PARKING SPOT AT WORK. AT THIS POINT I HAD TO ADD 2 QUARTS OF OIL TO GET TO READ ON THE DIP STICK. THIS WENT ON UNTIL MY NEXT OIL CHANGE AND I HAD VALVOLINE LOOK FOR ANY VISUAL LEAKS. THEY MENTIONED NOTHING THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF OIL BEING CONSUMED. FINALLY, IN MARCH OF 2013, TOOK MY JEEP TO A CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THEM START AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST. AFTER THE FIRST 500 MILES THEY STATED THERE WAS LOSS OF OIL AND MADE THERE MARKS AND RESEALED EVERYTHING FOR THE NEXT 500 MILES. I TOOK IT BACK IN AT THE NEXT 500 MILE MARK, NOW MIND YOU EVERYTHING IS SEALED SO THEY KNOW NOTHING WAS TAMPERED WITH, PERFORMANCE CHRYSLER CALLED ME AND TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT OIL LOSS AND THEY STATED THE RINGS ON THE PISTONS ARE BAD AND NEED TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $3,300. MY COMPLAINT IS, MY JEEP AT THIS POINT HAS 47000 MILES ON IT AND THEY ARE TELLING ME THE RINGS ARE BAD. I'VE HAD VEHICLES THAT LASTED 120,000+ AND NO PROBLEMS WITH THE RINGS ON THE PISTONS. I HAVE TALKED TO A COUPLE OF MECHANICS AND SAID THERE SHOULD BE NO WAY THE RINGS SHOULD HAVE GONE BAD THAT FAST.  *TR",

NO FURTHER INCIDENTS FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND IT HAPPENED AGAIN CAUSING ME SUDDENLY STOP WHEN PULLING INTO TRAFFIC AND NEARLY GETTING T-BONED. A FEW WEEKS LATER IT HAPPENED AGAIN AND I BEGAN TO TALK WITH OTHER JEEP OWNERS AND FOUND THIS WAS, AND STILL IS, AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH JEEP WRANGLERS FROM 2007-CURRENT.  FURTHER RESEARCH ON MY PART LED TO FINDING A TSB #21-001-10 REV A  DATED 4-20-2010. THIS POPPING OUT OF GEAR HAPPENS VERY SPORADICALLY AND WITHOUT ANY WARNING, HAS CAUSED ME TO NEARLY BECOME IN AN ACCIDENT (T-BONE OR REAR ENDED) BY THE SUDDEN, ALMOST EXPLOSIVE STOP ONE MAKES WHEN IT HAPPENS. ABOUT A MONTH AGO THIS BEGAN TO SLOWLY HAPPEN MORE OFTEN - TO THE POINT THAT I GOT IN THE HABIT OF HOLDING THE TRANSMISSION IN 1ST GEAR SO IT WOULD NOT POP OUT. WHEN I HAD THIS VEHICLE TO THE DEALER I BOUGHT IT FROM FOR ROUTINE SERVICE, I ASKED THE SERVICE TECH. ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION ISSUE AND WAS ADVISED THAT IT WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM AND SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE POWER TRAIN WARRANTY. THIS POPPING OUT BEGAN TO HAPPEN AS OFTEN AS 3 TIMES A DAY RESULTING IN MORE \"CLOSE CALLS\" AND, TSB IN HAND, I SCHEDULED THE  PROBLEM TO BE CORRECTED AT THE DEALER. I HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT THIS IS A $1200.00 REPAIR AND, AFTER THE WARRANTY PAYMENT, I WILL OWE ABOUT $400.00.  THIS REALLY IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR SOME TIME AND, I THINK MERITS FURTHER INVESTIGATION BY YOU FOLKS.  I SEE RECALLS FOR THE WRANGLER FOR THINGS LIKE FLOOR MATS AND AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION SENSORS WHICH \"MAY\" CAUSE AN ACCIDENT - THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR SOME TIME TO THE MANUFACTURER AND DOCUMENTED BY TSB REFERENCED ABOVE.

WAS TOLD THEY NEVER HEARD OF GAS COMING BACK OUT I MUST BE DOING SOMETHING WRONG AND THE SHIMMY WAS \"NORMAL\" FOR JEEPS.  BEEN HAVING MAJOR ISSUES WITH THIS TRUCK IT HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP MORE THAN ANY VEHICLE I HAVE EVER OWNED.  I'VE ONLY BOUGHT USED.  I'VE HAD TO HAVE THE 02 SENSORS CHANGED 4 TIMES.  I HAVE MY TIRES BALANCED SEVERAL TIMES.  MY TIRES ROTATED.  ALIGNMENTS, ETC.  I HAVE ALSO REPLACED THE STEERING DAMPER.  FAST FORWARD TO 2013.  SHIMMY IS SO BAD I ALMOST TOOK OUT ANOTHER DRIVER.  THANKFULLY I'M A COMMERCIALLY TRAINED DRIVER OTHERWISE IT COULD HAVE ENDED BADLY.  STILL HAVE GAS POURING OUT EVERY FILL UP.  02 SENSORS STILL KEEP CRAPPING OUT.  HEAD GASKETS HAD TO BE REPLACED ALREADY.  I FINALLY HAD ENOUGH AND TOLD DEALER THEY NEED TO FIX NO MORE GAMES AND I FIND OUT ABOUT THE TSB FOR THE STEERING DAMPER.  THEN I ALSO HAVE TO BE TOLD THAT MY MAIN REAR OIL SEAL IS NOW LEAKING AND MY TRANNY COOLANT LINES ARE LEAKING???  OH AND WAS TOLD THAT ALL THIS WAS NORMAL FOR JEEPS AS WELL????   REALLY!!!!!    THE TRUCK ONLY HAS 66K MILES ON IT.  IT'S ALL ORIGINAL NO LIFT KITS, NO OFF ROADING, NOTHING.... THIS IS BULL... FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY I PAID FOR THIS VEHICLE SOMEBODY SHOULD BE DOING SOMETHING.  I FIND HIS SITE AND LO AND BEHOLD... I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE...  UNBELIEVABLE!!!!  *TR",

IT HAS NOT BEEN MODIFIED AT ALL. AS SAID IT IS MINT CONDITION. I MADE THE MISTAKE OF NOT DRIVING IT MUCH, ESPECIALLY ON HIGHWAY FIRST SEVERAL YEARS I HAD IT. I DROVE A OLDER CAR AS MY EVERYDAY VEHICLE. THE JEEP WAS AND IS MY TOY. I HAD TO START DRIVING IT MORE IN 2011, THAT'S WHEN THE PROBLEM WAS CLEAR. WHENEVER I AM DRIVING AT OVER 50-55 MPH, AND I HIT A BUMP OR GROOVE IN ROAD IT RANDOMLY GOES INTO THIS VIOLENT SHAKE. THE SAME SHAKE DESCRIBED AND SEEN ON THE INTERNET. I FINALLY DID TAKE IT TO A JEEP DEALER, NOT EXPECTING MUCH. DUE TO THE FACT THAT MY WARRANTY WAS EXPIRED. BUT DUE TO THE FACT OF THE VERY LOW MILEAGE AND SHOWROOM APPEARANCE OF CAR, I WAS ABLE TO CONVINCE THEM TO ADDRESS PROBLEM AT NO CHARGE TO ME, SO FOR. I SAY SO FOR, DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE DEALER HAS REPLACED NUMEROUS PARTS UNDERNEATH, BUT PROBLEM STILL THERE. NOW I AM WAITING FOR DECISION FROM HIGHER UPS AT JEEP TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH ME. I FEEL THAT THERE IS SOME ENGINEERING PROBLEMS OVERLOOKED WHEN DESIGNED AND BUILT. THEY(JEEP) KNOW THEY HAVE A MAJOR PROBLEM.I AM VERY SURPRISED THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A DEATH INVOLVED WITH THIS. IT IS SERIOUS. MY WIFE REFUSES TO DRIVE IN MY JEEP. SHE CALLS IT CHRISTINES LITTLE SISTER CARLA. I AM STUCK.

TODAY I TOOK IT IN TO A LOCAL ALIGNMENT SHOP SO THEY CAN DIAGNOSE IT AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THE WHOLE FRONT STEERING ASSEMBLY IS ABOUT SHOT!

THIS BRACKET HAS THREE LUG NUTS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THE SPARE AND, BECAUSE OF THE CRACK, ONE OF THE LUGS WAS NOT PROVIDING ANY SUPPORT FOR THE APPROXIMATELY 150-POUND TIRE AND WHEEL.  A CRACK AROUND ONE OF THE OTHER TWO LUGS WOULD LIKELY CAUSE A COMPLETE FAILURE OF THE HOUSING SUPPORT, AS I DOUBT ONE LUG COULD HOLD THE HEAVY SPARE AND WHEEL.

IN ADDITION, THE FRONT END OF THE VEHICLE VIBRATED AND SHOOK VIOLENTLY.  I HAD NO PLACE TO STOP, A BUS WAS BEHIND ME, AND I HAD TROUBLE KEEPING MY JEEP IN ONE LANE.  SINCE THERE WAS NO PLACE TO PULL OVER, I SLOWED DOWN AND WHEN I REACHED A SPEED BETWEEN 15 TO 20 MILES PER HOUR, THE SHAKING STOPPED AND I WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE ON.  DURING MY TRIP THAT DAY, I HAD THREE MORE EPISODES OF VIOLENT SHAKING AS I HIT BUMPS IN THE ROAD WHEN I WAS TRAVELING BETWEEN 50 AND 60 MILES PER HOUR.  I HAD RECENTLY READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND THIS ISSUE APPEARS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM FOR JEEP WRANGLERS, ALTHOUGH I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM BEFORE.  MY JEEP IS A 2007 4-DOOR WRANGLER WHICH ONLY HAS 10,400 MILES ON IT BECAUSE I USUALLY KEEP IT GARAGED AT A BEACH HOME IN DELAWARE AND I USE IT ONLY DURING SUMMER WEEKENDS.  THE JEEP IS A STOCK MODEL WITH NO AFTER MARKET MODIFICATIONS.  I HAD DRIVEN IT HOME TO MARYLAND TO HAVE A DEALER CHECKUP BEFORE I RETURNED THE JEEP TO THE BEACH.  THE PROBLEM HAPPENED ON MY THIRD TRIP AFTER THE DEALER SERVICE BUT IT WAS MY FIRST TRIP DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY.  MY DAUGHTER WAS IN THE CAR WITH ME AND SHE AND I WERE EXTREMELY DISTURBED AND CONSIDER THIS ISSUE A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE.  SINCE MY RESEARCH INDICATES THIS IS A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM, I FEEL STRONGLY THE  NTSB SHOULD TAKE THE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO HAVE CHRYSLER ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BEFORE THERE IS A FATALITY.  I AM EXTREMELY THANKFUL THAT THE BUS BEHIND ME IN THE BALTIMORE HARBOR TUNNEL HAD GOOD BRAKES.  *TR",

THIS AS KNOWN AS THE JEEP DEATH WOBBLE.  IT HAS NOW DONE IT 5 TIMES, 3 OF WHICH WERE AFTER THE DEALERSHIP SAID THEY FIXED IT.  THE FIRST TIME THEY PUT A NEW DAMPER ON IT.  NOW IT IS IN THE SHOP AGAIN AFTER THAT DIDN'T WORK AND THEY ARE PUTTING NEW TIRES ON IT.  AFTER READING MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS ONLINE, IT IS APPARENT TO ME THAT NEW TIRES ARE NOT GOING TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  EVERY TIME YOUR FRONT END SHAKES VIOLENTLY LIKE THAT, THE CHANCES OF DAMAGING COMPONANTS FURTHER INCREASES.  MY RESEARCH HAS ALSO SHOWN ME THAT MANY, MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS HAPPEN TO THEM AND THEY HAVE HAD TROUBLE GETTING ANYONE TO STEP UP AND FIX THE PROBLEM.  IF YOU DO A SIMPLE SEARCH FOR JEEP DEATH WOBBLE YOU WILL FIND HUNDREDS OF PAGES FOR COMPLAINTS.  MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OCCURED ON DECEMBER 23, 2011, AND MY MOST RECENT EXPERIENCE WAS ON FEBRUARY 17, 2012.  5 DEATH WOBBLES IN ALL, AND IT GETS WORSE EACH TIME.  HAVING LITTLE CONTROL OVER THE STEERING AND FRONT END CREATES WHAT I AM SURE YOU WILL SEE IS A DEADLY COMBINATION IN ANY CONDITION.  *TR",

JEEP \"STRONGLY SUGGESTED\" THAT I DO THIS EVEN THOUGH MY OLD TIRES, ORIGINAL JEEP WRANGLER TIRES, WERE IN GOOD CONDITION. JEEP REFUSED TO PAY FOR THE TIRES EVEN THOUGH IT ACKNOWLEDGED THE DEATH WOBBLE HAD  WORN PATTERNS IN THE OLD TIRES. JEEP PUT IN A MOPAR STABILIZER, AND INSISTED THIS WOULD CURE THE MANUFACTURING DEFECT.  TWO WEEKS AFTER INSTALLATION OF THE NEW TIRES AND NEW STABILIZER/DAMPER BY THE AUTHORIZED JEEP SERVICE PROVIDER, THE DEATH WOBBLE RECURRED. I IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT TO THE JEEP DEALERSHIP AND THE DEATH WOBBLE WAS REPLICATED BY THE SERVICE MANAGER WHO DROVE THE WRANGLER WHILE I WAS SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. AFTER HAGGLING, JEEP AGREED TO REPLACE THE STABILIZER. THIS IS STILL IN THE PROCESS OF BEING RESOLVED. SEVERAL THINGS TO REMEMBER: (1) CALL JEEP, REGARDLESS OF THE YEAR OF YOUR VEHICLE OR WARRANTY STATUS. PLEASE, DON'T LET JEEP CUSTOMER SERVICE TELL YOU THAT YOUR VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY AND THEY ARE NOT ACCOUNTABLE. KNOWN MANUFACTURING DEFECTS HAVE NO WARRANTY LIMITATIONS AND RECALLS CAN BE MADE REGARDLESS OF OUT-OF-WARRANTY STATUS. (2) PRESS JEEP FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR ALL OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES YOU'VE MADE TRYING TO FIX THEIR PROBLEM. I WAS NOT 100% SUCCESSFUL, BUT I AM STILL APPEALING TO THEM, ESPECIALLY SINCE REPAIRS WERE MADE BY THEIR OWN DEALERSHIP. MY NEXT STEP WILL BE THE SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF NOT FEDERAL. (3) REPORT THIS PROBLEM TO THE NHTSA! THE DEATH WOBBLE IS REAL AND IT PUTS LIVES AT RISK. IF THERE ARE NO COMPLAINTS, THERE ARE NO RECALLS OR FIXES, AND LIVES WILL BE LOST, IF THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY. (4) ASK YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS IF THEY'VE NOTICED THIS PROBLEM. UNFORTUNATELY, MANY DRIVERS THINK IT'S AN ISOLATED ISSUE. IT IS NOT, AND JEEP IS AWARE OF IT.   *KB",

ALTERNATIVELY, JUST TRAVELING ABOVE 40-45 MPH ON A HIGHWAY, ESPECIALLY ON A CURVE, WILL REPLICATE. IF ANY OTHER JEEP DRIVER HAS THIS PROBLEM, THE ONLY WAY TO PROTECT YOURSELF IS TO BRAKE SLOWLY, GET OFF THE ROAD AND DRIVE UNDER 40 MPH...AND MUCH SLOWER WHILE TURNING EVEN ON SIDE STREETS. IF YOU MUST DRIVE ON A HIGHWAY, STAY IN THE SLOW LANE SO THAT YOU CAN EXIT TO THE SHOULDER WITH RELATIVE SAFETY, AND ENGAGE YOUR HAZARD LIGHTS.

THE CONSISTENCY OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE DESIGN ERROR IN THE STEERING AND FRONT END OF THESE VEHICLES IS OVERWHELMING.      SECOND ISSUE IS THAT MY GAS TANK DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE AUTO-CUT-OFF FOR GAS PUMP OPERATIONS -- WHENEVER I FILL UP THE TANK, THE GAS RUSHES UP THE TANK LINE WITH APPARENTLY NO BAFFLING AND COMES POURING OUT.  AND NO, I AM NOT AN IDIOT WHO IS OVERFILLING THE TANK -- WHETHER THE PUMP IS ON AUTOMATIC FILL, OR I DO IT CAREFULLY MANUALLY, THE SAME THING HAPPENS -- THE TANK SUDDENLY FILLS AND SHOOTS GAS OUT OF THE FILLER CAP AREA.

AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF DIAGNOSING THIS ISSUE, I REMOVED THE FRONT TRACTION BAR AND NOTICED THAT THE BOLT HOLES ON BOTH THE FRAME AND AXLE BRACKETS THAT SECURE THE TRACTION BAR HAD BECOME ELONGATED.  DUE TO THE VEHICLE BEING OUT OF WARRANTY, I TOOK IT TO A WELDING SHOP.  THEY ADVISED ME THAT THE ONLY WAY TO FIX THIS PROBLEM WOULD BE TO WELD A HEAVY DUTY WASHER ON BOTH SIDES OF EACH MOUNTING BRACKET TO SECURE THE MOUNTING BOLTS.  THE WELDING SHOP ALSO INFORMED ME THAT THIS WOULD NOT BE A PERMANENT FIX, BUT MAY LAST FOR A WHILE.  THEY ALSO INFORMED MY THAT THE METAL BRACKETS APPEARED TO BE MADE OF WEAK METAL AND THE BOLTS ARE GRADE 8.  THEY SAID THIS EXPLAINS THAT THE BRACKET IS WEAKER THAN THE BOLT AND THAT IS WHY THE BRACKETS GAVE WAY.  AFTER THE WASHERS WERE WELDED ON THE BRACKETS, THE SHAKING HAS GONE AND HAS NOT RETURNED.   I HAVE READ ON JK-FORUM.COM OF MANY OTHER JEEP WRANGLERS THAT HAVE HAD THIS EXACT SAME PROBLEM.  THIS IS A DANGEROUS PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED.  *TR",

THIS IS MY SECOND 2007 JEEP WRANGLER AND BOTH HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME MILEAGE.  EACH VEHICLE WAS FILLED WITH THE CORRECT GASOLINE AS PRESCRIBED BY THE MANUAL AND ALL MAINTENANCE WAS DONE AT A 5 STAR JEEP DEALER ON BOTH.  THERE APPEARS TO BE A DEFECT IN THE DESIGN OF THE GAS SYSTEM.",

AT 73K, THE PROBLEM STARTED AGAIN.  THIS TIME I TOOK IT THE JEEP DEALER. THEY KNEW WHAT THE \"DEATH WOBBLE\" WAS, AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD CHECK EVERYTHING. THEY REPORTED BACK THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE COMPONENTS, AND SUGGESTED I GET THE TIRES BALANCED AGAIN. I GOT THE TIRES BALANCED AND TOOK IT BACK A WEEK LATER TO THE DEALER AS THE PROBLEM WAS HAPPENING WITH MORE FREQUENCY, AND NOW WAS OCCURRING AT SPEEDS BETWEEN 45-55 MPH. I SUGGESTED A PARTICULAR PATCH OF HIGHWAY FOR A TEST DRIVE.  THEY CALLED ME BACK AND SAID, \"THERE IS SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG.\" THEY THEN WORKED WITH CHRYSLER TO IDENTIFY AND \"SOLVE\" THE PROBLEM. THEY REPLACED THE TIRE RODS  AND JOINTS. THREE DAYS LATER I EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM AGAIN, AND THEN AGAIN, AND AGAIN. I HAVE SPENT APPROXIMATELY $1400 TO \"FIX\" THIS PROBLEM, AND IT CONTINUES TO PERSIST.

AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT I WAS NOT ENGAGING IT PROPERLY, BUT I'VE SUBSEQUENTLY TRIED TO HOLD IT IN 1ST GEAR AND IT FORCES ITSELF OUT OF GEAR SO HARD THAT IT ALMOST BROKE MY WRIST. I'VE NOTICED THAT IT POPS OUT MORE UPON LOW TO MEDIUM ACCELERATION. LAST MONTH, I APPROACHED AN INTERSECTION IN AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE A RIGHT HAD TURN. AS I ATTEMPTED TO MAKE THE TURN FROM A STOPPED POSITION, UPON MODERATE ACCELERATION, THE TRANSMISSION POPPED OUT OF FIRST GEAR AND LEFT ME STALLED IN NEUTRAL IN FRONT OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC. FORTUNATELY, THE VEHICLE BEHIND WAS ABLE TO SKID AND BARELY HIT MY SLOWED VEHICLE. AT THIS POINT MY WIFE STOPPED DRIVING THE VEHICLE AS SHE FELT IT WAS TWO DANGEROUS. I WAS NOW CONVINCED THAT THIS CONDITION WAS VERY UNSAFE AND RETURNED THE VEHICLE (@49,500 MILES) TO A JEEP DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR.

I REPORTED IT TO MY DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID (OH YEAH, THAT IS THE JEEP DEATH WOBBLE). IT IS PRETTY NORMAL, ALTHOUGH THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF IT ON THE NEW BODY STYLE.  *TR",

THE STALL OCCURRED ONCE AT HIGHWAY SPEED AND MOST RECENTLY WHILE ACCELERATING. WHEN THE STALL OCCURS, ALL ENGINE AND ALL ELECTRICAL FUNCTION CEASE FOR ABOUT 3-4 SECONDS. IT'S AS IF I TURNED THE KEY TO THE OFF POSITION. THEN ALL THE DASH LIGHTS ILLUMINATE AND THE ENGINE SEEMS TO RESTART ON ITS OWN (THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE FACT I HAVE A MANUAL TRANSMISSION AND THE WHEELS ARE ROLLING).  I KNOW OF AT LEAST 60 PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS ISSUE. THIS IS NOT ONLY AN INCONVENIENCE BUT EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. WHEN I EXPERIENCED THE STALL THE FIRST TIME I ALMOST WENT INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC. THE SECOND STALL HAD TRAFFIC SKIDDING TO STOP BEHIND ME AS THE JEEP LOST POWER AND ELECTRICAL WHILE I WAS ACCELERATING INTO TRAFFIC. I'VE TALKED TO A FEW DEALERS AND THEY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE ISSUE AND CAN OFFER NO REASONS AS TO WHY THE STALL IS OCCURRING. THIS IS DUE TO THE DEALERS NOT RECEIVING ANY TECHNICAL BULLETIN''S CONCERNING AN ISSUE OR EVEN A POTENTIAL ISSUE FROM DAIMLER CHRYSLER. THIS INDICATES TO ME ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IS BEING DONE AT THE DAIMLER CHRYSLER CORPORATE OFFICES. I AM A HUGE FAN OF JEEP AND HAVE OWNED THREE WRANGLERS IN THE PAST. I HATE THE FACT THAT MOST RECENT WRANGLER HAS THE POTENTIAL OF CAUSING A VERY SERIOUS ACCIDENT.",

I WAS ON MY WAY TO GET GAS AND MY GAS LIGHT WAS ON (I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS RELEVANT OR NOT BUT I WILL REPORT IT).  WHILE APPROACHING THE STOP SIGN, WITH THE CLUTCH PEDAL PUSHED TO THE FLOOR AT ABOUT 3 MPH THE VEHICLE JUST STALLED.  NO REAL WARNING JUST A FLASH OF THE RADIO LIGHTS AND DASH LIGHTS AND THE VEHICLE DIED.  I THOUGHT IT HAD RUN OUT OF GAS BUT IT STARTED RIGHT BACK UP.  THEN I THOUGHT POSSIBLY THE GAS WAS VERY LOW BUT THERE WERE STILL 2 GALLONS LEFT IN THE TANK AS I FOUND OUT WHEN I FILLED UP THE TANK 2 MINUTES LATER.  AFTER THIS HAPPENED I RESEARCHED THIS \"STALL\" A LITTLE MORE ONLINE.  I CAME ACROSS JK-FORUM.COM AND THIS WAS NOT JUST AN ISOLATED INCIDENT.  THIS IS A VERY WIDE SPREAD PROBLEM IN WHICH THE DEALERS POKE AND HOPE WITH THEIR REPAIRS AND THEY DO NOT WORK.  THIS IS A VERY BIG SAFETY ISSUE.  I THINK ABOUT IT EVERYTIME I SET IN MY VEHICLE NOW WAITING FOR IT TO STALL IN AN EVEN WORSE SITUATION SUCH AS A HIGHWAY OFF OR ON RAMP OR SOMETHING. CHRYSLER MUST BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR FINDING A FIX ASAP IN MY OPINION.  *TR",

THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN IN THE FACT THAT DURING THIS TIME PERIOD ALL VEHICLE CONTROL IS LOST.  THIS HAS HAPPENED AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.    I HAVE TAKEN THE JEEP TO THE DEALERSHIP MORE THAN ONCE REGARDING THIS PROBLEM. THEY REPORT THAT THEY CANNOT DUPLICATE THE ISSUE, AND PRETTY MUCH ACT AS IF IT IS A NON-ISSUE SINCE THEY CAN'T REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM.*AK",
