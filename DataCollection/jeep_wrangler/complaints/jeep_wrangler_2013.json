It had 55k miles so it would have been out of warranty. Recently, I had the pab recall work done at a local Jeep dealership. About a month later, my airbag light started coming on intermittently. Because of the timing of the recall work, I went back to that dealership to have them diagnose/see if they were the cause/etc..  They diagnosed it as needing the clockspring.  I have been told by two local Jeep dealerships and the folks at 1-877-amjeep that even though the extended warranty on the clockspring applies to ALL NAFTA market vehicles, they wont fix it under warranty.  I was actually told, \"...the warranty it didn't have at the time it crossed into the US was voided, thus nullifying any future extended warranty that could would have covered other parts.\"  FCA did this extended warranty nonsense to avoid a recall, and if they arent honoring the extended warranty, then there ought to be a recall on the clockspring.

The brake then relieved enough pressure to allow the vehicle to roll back into a hole form where a stump had been.  Fortunately I was not injured and the Jeep did not collide with anything.  This emphasized to me a previously-known safety issue with the product.  The design of the brake lever is supposed to be self-adjusting, however in reality, the clutch mechanism to do this allows slippage to the point where the handle hits the backstop prior to engaging the brakes on many Wrangler JKs that are only a few years old. This is a well documented problem in JK forums and many owners have created workarounds to force the mechanism to maintain tension on the parking brake cables. I have not done this to mine, and consequentially have not had a reliably functioning for years.  For obvious reasons, this flaw in the parking brake design (especially on vehicles offered with manual transmissions puts public safety at risk.   Ilderton Chrysler Jeep Dodge in Winston Salem failed this vehicle on safety inspection in 2020 as a result of this, but I did not authorize a diagnostic investigation, as I was already aware of the problem.  I was able to jiggle the parking brake enough to cause it to engage enough to pass inspection.  Within 1 - 2 pulls, the brake was completely unusable again.  I have checked parking brake shoe to drum clearance and verified that the rear is adjusted correctly for engagement. The problem only exists in the design of the lever.  No warning lamps related to the lever/integrated switch.",

AFTER CHANGING THE SPARK PLUGS AND IGNITION COILS ON THE DRIVERS SIDE BANK OF CYLINDERS (2,4,AND 6) THE TROUBLE CODE STILL CONTINUED TO POP UP ABOUT EVERY WEEK OR TWO. I THEN TOOK IT TO MY LOCAL JEEP, CHRYSLER, RAM DEALER TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH I FOUND OUT THAT THE CYLINDER HEADS ON THE PENTASTAR ENGINE IN THE 2012 AND 2013 JEEP WRANGLERS WERE HAVE MANY, MANY ISSUES WITH THE BAD CYLINDER HEADS BECAUSE OF THERE WAS TWO DIFFERENT METALS USED BETWEEN THE ENGINE BLOCK AND THE CYLINDER HEAD CAUSING IT TO WARP AND CAUSE COMPRESSION ISSUES IN THE CYLINDER. JEEP WAS WELL AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM BUT REFUSED TO THIS DAY TO ISSUE A RECALL. AFTER THE DEALER TOOK THE ENGINE APART TO INVESTIGATE, HE ADMITTED TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS A BAD CYLINDER HEAD. THIS MISFIRE ON CYLINDER 6 OCCURRED MOSTLY WHEN IDLING AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT OR AT VERY LOW SPEEDS. THE KICKER IN ALL OF THIS EVEN THOUGH JEEP ADMITTED A FAULTY CYLINDER HEAD WAS THE CAUSE OF THE LOSS OF COMPRESSION, THEY REFUSED TO REPLACE THE CYLINDER HEAD AT THEIR COST. BECAUSE JEEP DID NOT HAVE MY VIN NUMBER IN THEIR LIST TO BE REPAIRED, IT WAS UP TO ME TO PICK UP THE COST. I DID NOTHING IN THE TIME THAT I HAVE HAD THIS VEHICLE (ORIGINAL OWNER) TO MAKE A CYLINDER HEAD BECOME WARPED. THIS WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE PENTASTAR ENGINE FROM THE BEGINNING.

I WAS TOLD WHEN I BOUGHT IT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT BUT THAT WAS A LIE. I NEED HELP FIGURE THIS OUT. THE DEALERSHIP DIDN'T MAKE SURE THAT THIS VEHICLE WAS SAFELY OPERATIONAL BEFORE SELLING IT. IT OVER HEATED BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T CHECK FLUID. MY HEATED SEATS WERE BURNT OUT. MY DASH LIGHTS FLICKER ON AND OFF. THEY REPLACED SOMETHING BEHIND MY DASH BUT IT DIDN'T FIX THE ISSUE. I THINK IT MADE IT WORSE. AS OF RIGHT NOW MY JEEP SHUTS UP AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK WHICH PUTS ME IN A DANGEROUS POSITION BECAUSE I GET STUCK EITHER ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD SITTING SIDEWAYS OR ALMOST OFF OF A CLIFF OR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD WITH NOWHERE TO GO BECAUSE I HAVE NO POWER STEERING THE JEEP DOES IT START BACK UP FOR ANYWHERE BETWEEN 5 TO 15 MINUTES.",

I GET A CALL TWO DAYS LATER STATING MY EMERGENCY BREAK SYSTEM HAD FAULTED AND  ENGAGED IT'S SELF SNAPPING MY AXEL, SPEED SENSOR AND BREAK ROTOR. ALL OF THESE THINGS WERE RIPPED AND EVERYTHING WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED DUE TO EMERGENCY BREAK SYSTEM FAILURE.

THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED BY THE MANUFACTURER  DO TO IT BEING FAULTY EMERGENCY BRAKE SYSTEM.",

I FILED AN ATTORNEY GENERALS COMPLAINT ON 8 FEBUARY 2017 AND SINCE DECEMBER 2016 AM NOT ABLE TO GET TO SHOP DUE TO DELAYS FROM DEALERSHIP.  I WAS PUT IN CONTACT WITH MR. BROWN EXTENSION 2302 TO EXPLAIN HARDSHIPS AND IN DECEMBER 2016 NOT TO MENTION NOT RESTORING MY VEHICLE TO FACTORY SPECIFICATIONS AND PUTTING A SUBSTANCE ON MY VEHICLE WITHOUT PERMISSION.  \"",

THERE WAS NO WARNING AT ALL AND IT TOOK ME A SECOND TO REALIZE IT HAD STALLED. I WAS ABLE TO ROLL OUT OF THE TRAFFIC LANE ONTO A SIDE ROAD. THE POLICE SHOWED UP AND HELPED ME PUSH IT OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. AT THAT POINT I TRIED TO START IT, APPROXIMATELY 10MINS AFTER STALLING AND IT STARTED RIGHT UP. I WENT STRAIGHT TO AUTOZONE AND HAD A NEW BATTERY INSTALLED, $250.00 AND GOT GOING ON MY WAY HOME - FAT, DUMB AND HAPPY - UNTIL 2 DAYS LATER WHEN IT DID IT AGAIN. THE SECOND TIME IT STALLED I WAS ON A BUSY 12 LANE INTERSTATE 95 IN DOWNTOWN MIAMI. AGAIN I DID NOT KNOW IT HAD STALLED, I WAS INCREASING SPEED FROM ABOUT 50MPH TO 60MPH AND PUSHED THE GAS PEDAL AND NOTHING HAPPENED. I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF 6 LANES AND IMMEDIATELY PUT MY HAZARDS ON AND ROLLED THROUGH TRAFFIC ONTO THE SIDE OF THE INTERSTATE. I WAITED 5 MINS AND IT STARTED RIGHT UP AND I WENT STRAIGHT TO THE CHRYSLER DEALER IN KENDALL, FL. THEY GAVE ME A RENTAL VEHICLE - THANK GOD. ABOUT 3 WEEKS LATER THEY CHANGED OUT THE PCM AND GAVE IT BACK TO ME - FIXED (SUPPOSEDLY). 2 WEEKS LATER IT STALLED IN TRAFFIC ON A 4 LANE HWY; WAITED 5 MINS AND IT STARTED FINE, WAS LATER AT THE STORE GOT IN THE VEHICLE AND IT WOULD NOT START JUST KEPT TRYING TO CRANK ITSELF, WAITED 5 MINS LATER AND IT STARTED. THAT WEEKEND TOOK IT TO CHRYSLER IN TAMPA (JERRY ULM) THEY SAID IT IS NOT IN MY WARRANTY AND I PAID $400.00 FOR WHAT I WAS TOLD WAS A CHRYSLER \"WORK AROUND\". 2 DAYS LATER IT WOULD NOT START AND IT TRIED TO CRANK ITSELF. I TURNED THE KEY OFF AND WAITED 5 MINS AND IT STARTED RIGHT UP AND I WENT DIRECTLY TO KENDAL CHRYSLER, WHERE IT IS SITTING TODAY AS I WRITE THIS.",

BACK IN DECEMBER LAST YEAR, YOU SENT ME TWO RECALL NOTICES CONCERNING THE HEATED MIRRORS ON JEEP WRANGLERS. AT THE TIME, I REMOVED THE FUSE FROM POSITION M35 TO DISABLE THIS FEATURE PER THE NOTICES, AND WAITED FOR THE LETTER ANNOUNCING THAT PARTS WERE AVAILABLE TO CORRECT THE CONDITION. THAT LETTER CAME SOMETIME IN MARCH AND I CALLED THE NUMBER TO SCHEDULE AN       APPOINTMENT SOMETIME IN MID-APRIL AND WAS SCHEDULED FOR REPAIRS ON 5/20/15 AT 7:00AM. I SPECIFICALLY TOLD THE GIRL MAKING THE APPOINTMENT THAT I DID NOT HAVE A RIDE AND WOULD HAVE TO WAIT ON MY VEHICLE. SHE TOLD ME THAT WOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM IF I GOT THERE ON TIME AND THEY COULD MOVE IT THROUGH PRETTY QUICKLY.    YESTERDAY (5/19/15) A RECORDED MESSAGE WAS LEFT ON MY VOICE MAIL REMINDING OF THE APPOINTMENT TODAY. SO FAR SO GOOD.     THIS MORNING IS WHERE THE INCONVENIENCE OCCURRED. AFTER ARRIVING AT THE DEALER AT 7:00AM, I WAS INFORMED THAT THEY WERE RUNNING BEHIND AND STILL HAD 11 VEHICLES LEFT OVER FROM YESTERDAY. THEY SAID THEY COULD PROBABLY GET TO MINE LATE THIS     AFTERNOON, OR POSSIBLY TOMORROW MORNING. SINCE THIS JEEP IS MY ONLY VEHICLE, THAT IS VIRTUALLY AN IMPOSSIBILITY FOR ME. I HAD ALREADY REARRANGED MY SCHEDULE TO BE THERE THIS MORNING.    NOW I STILL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WITH NO RESOLUTION.    NEEDLESS TO SAY, I VIEW THIS AS VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AT LEAST AT THE DEALER LEVEL AND I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT.          [XXX]    CC: BENCHMARK CHRYSLER JEEP DODGE        NHTSA",

THEY CONTINUALLY TELL ME THAT THEY CANNOT GET THE REQUIRED PARTS FROM THE FACTORY, BUT WHEN THEY DO THEY WILL CALL ME.  I CALLED THE FACTORY RECALL ASSISTANCE CENTER (1-800-853-1403) LISTED ON THE RECALL NOTICE AND THE PERSON WHO ANSWERED GAVE ME THE SAME STORY;  \"CHRYSLER IS HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THE REQUIRED PARTS FROM THEIR SUPPLIER\".  I AM CERTAIN CHRYSLER HAS THE ABILITY TO BUILD ANYTHING, SO THE FACT THAT THEY SAY THEY CAN'T GET SOME SIMPLE HOSES BUILT IS A RIDICULOUS EXCUSE. IT IS CLEAR THAT CHRYSLER IS NOT RESPONDING SINCERELY TO THIS NHTSA RECALL.  PERHAPS, LIKE THE CHEVY IGNITION KEY FOB ISSUE, COST VS SAFETY IS MORE IMPORTANT TO YET ANOTHER AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURER.  NOTE THAT THE CHRYSLER NOTICE DID SAY THAT IF THE DEALER FAILS TO REMEDY THE DEFECT WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME TO FILE A COMPLAINT AT WWW.SAFERCAR.GOV AND THIS FORM IS THE ONLY COMPLAINT FORM I COULD ACCESS FROM THAT SITE.  IF THIS IS THE WRONG FORM PLEASE REDIRECT MY COMPLAINT TO THE CORRECT LOCATION.  *TR",

AS INSTRUCTED IN RECALL NOTICE I SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT WITH DEALER- MAGNUSSENS DODGE CHRYSLER JEEP, LOCATED AT 1901 GRASS VALLEY HWY, AUBURN, CA 95603, PH (530)885-2900. ON 02/05/2014, I BROUGHT MY VEHICLE IN TO GET SAFETY RECALL REPAIRS DONE. MR. BRIAN EVANS #1028, WHO IS A SERVICE ADVISOR WITH MAGNUSSEN, STATED THEY DID NOT HAVE A REQUIRED PART. I FOUND THIS SITUATION RATHER STRANGE. TWO WEEKS BEFORE MY APPOINTMENT I WAS REASSURED THAT PART WOULD BE THERE. SINCE I WAS ALREADY THERE WITH MY VEHICLE I BROUGHT TO HIS ATTENTION UNRELATED TO SAFETY RECALL NOTICE MECHANICAL ISSUE (POSSIBLE SQUEAKING BELT NOISE). AFTER INSPECTION OF MY 2013 JEEP WITH 10K ON ODOMETER, THEY TOLD ME THAT IT NEEDS A NEW WATER PUMP? THEY REPLACED, FREE OF CHARGE, A WATER PUMP (INVOICE 189828). THEY HOLD MY JEEP IN THEIR SHOP FOR TWO DAYS. COMMUNICATIONS WITH SERVICE ADVISOR/DEPARTMENT WERE HORRIBLE. I HAVE TO SPEND SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME JUST TO LOCATE AND CONTACT THEIR SERVICE MANAGER IN ORDER TO KNOW WHEN MY VEHICLE WILL BE READY FOR PICK UP. WHEN I FINALLY PICKED MY JEEP UP ON 02/07/2014 [XXX].  TOLD ME AGAIN THAT REQUIRED TRANSMISSION OIL COOLER TUBE WOULD BE THERE SOON. HE PROMISED THIS REPLACEMENT PART ??WILL BE RESERVED FOR MY VEHICLE?? AND HE WILL CONTACT ME AS SOON AS HE GETS IT??. HERE WE ARE IN THE BEGINNING OF MONTH MAY?. I AM STILL WAITING TO HEAR FROM MAGNUSSENS DODGE CHRYSLER JEEP. ALL MY ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT SAID SERVICE ADVISOR WENT NOWHERE. MOREOVER, THANKS TO MAGNUSSENS I AM DRIVING THIS UNSAFE JEEP EVERY DAY.

THEY ARE FAILING TO MAKE THE PARTS AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT TO RUN OUT OF STOCK! REALLY? WE ARE DRIVING THESE VEHICLES THAT COST NEARLY $40,000! AND ENDANGERING OUR LIVES BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO DEPLETE THEIR STOCK. ARE THEY MAKING THE PARTS IN SOMEBODY'S BASEMENT?!
