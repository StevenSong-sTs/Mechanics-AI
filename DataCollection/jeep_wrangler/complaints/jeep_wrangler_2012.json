I immediately pulled off the interstate for a visual inspection of the breaks and brake fluid but did not see any glaring issues.   I took the vehicle to a local shop, they read the code (C2200) and advised I needed a new ABS Control Module (Mopar Part #68145835AE).  The local shop advised the Module is difficult to find, but they found one and would complete the work for $2,400.00 ($1,500 of which was for the ABS Module part).  I called a local Chrystler, dodge, Jeep (Lou Fusz) dealer in O'Fallon to price verify the part. I scheduled an appointment for three weeks out. They also confirmed the code and need to replace the ABS Module for $1,500.00 ($881.00 of which was for the ABS Module part); HOWEVER,  Jeep-Mopar told the dealership that the part is not available until March 20 of 2024 which would leave me with two options.  1) Sell the vehicle to the dealer; however, their offer took advantage of the ABS issue and was extremely low 2) Wait and drive the faulty vehicle  Driving the Jeep with a faulty ABS Module may jeopardize critical systems, resulting in poor braking performance and potentially create a very dangerous or deadly situation.  A search of this issue online in Jeep Forums has shown mass number of similar issues and others experiencing the same part deadly; meaning there are an untold number of jeeps driving with a faulty ABS Module.  I pled to the NHTSA to please investigate and pressure Jeep to issue a Recall to ensure safety.",

After the engine (long block) was replaced, one of the cylinders was miss firing.  This miss firing was traced to micro cracks in the plastic/composite intake manifold (original and not part of the engine replacement). Because these micro cracks changed the fuel air ratio on specific cylinders by leaning out the cylinders near the cracks this lean mixture would cause the affected cylinders to run hot that would lead to both the excessive ware on the one cylinder and would comprise the catalytic converters.  Because this change in fuel air mixture was caused by the intake manifold and Jeep does not have any inspection requirements or methods for this item and even after the Jeep Dealer did a full diagnosis using their factory specified equipment the issue with the manifold was not found.  My local AMMCO shop found the cracking in the manifold that was the route cause of the problem.",

This information was provided to me by the Chrysler/ Dodge/ Ram /Jeep Dealership from where we purchased the vehicle new, and that has done all of the repair work on this vehicle since we bought it.

Also this vehicle has never been used off-road or for any extreme off-road activities, solely on road use. I did contact Chrysler in regards to my concerns, but other than attempting to get the part shipped sooner, I was told the vehicle is out of warranty and there is no recall on it so there is nothing they can do.",

It was brought in for service due to some issues with the dash screen lighting, right blinker, and the heater. They first told me that all parts were on back order. I looked up the parts myself as I have a wholesale account and I showed that they were not on back order. I let them know this and conveniently, they were able to get all parts within a week. They called me when the vehicle was done for repairs and when I was driving it home, I noticed that the odometer was off by 23,000 miles. When I drove my vehicle home after having work done, it was at 74,355 miles. The dealership told me to bring it in right away. I brought it in the next day at 4:30pm. After a week, they told me that Chilson's Jeep dealership gave them the wrong information when they were replacing the cluster for the dash lights and they did not reprogram it correctly. They asked me how long I was planning on keeping the vehicle because if I kept it for a while, then I would be okay if I went over the initial 97,000 miles and no one would know. They also gave me the option for them to buy it back. This was on 1/9/23. I called them on 1/11/23 and told them I did not want to keep the vehicle as it was a liability and illegal to roll back an odometer in a vehicle and the title would have to be changed along with other risks that are incorporated with it. I talked to my insurance company and other dealership owners in the area and no one was comfortable with me keeping the vehicle due to legalities and risks associated with this. Chippewa Valley Mazda Sales Managers Adam and Nariah both told me they would only give me the purchase price and would not pay for anything over that. If they bought it back then I would need to come in with the vehicle and a check for over $6,000+. There is an open DOT Investigation on this. Adam stated today, 1/16/23 that they need my vehicle off their lot because it can't stay there and the loaner back",

IT IS VERY RANDOM AND UNPREDICTABLE MAKING IT EVEN MORE DANGEROUS. I COULD BE PULLING OUT INTO A BUSY INTERSECTION, TAKING OFF FROM A STOP SIGN/ LIGHT OR PULLING OUT FROM A PARKING SPACE INTO TRAFFIC AND MY SHIFTER WILL SUDDENLY JUMP OUT OF FIRST GEAR INTO NEUTRAL, CAUSING THE CAR TO LOSE ALL POWER. THERE IS A LOUD SOUND AND A FEELING OF SCRAPING LIKE THE GEARS ARE BEING STRIPPED. THE STEERING ALSO GETS VERY SHAKY EVEN AT LOW SPEEDS (APPROX 40 MPH) IN THE SAME WAY IT WOULD AT A HIGH SPEED WHEN IN NEED OF A HIGH SPEED BALANCE. THIS IS MY 3RD JEEP WRANGLER, ALL OF WHICH HAVE HAD MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS (A 1989, 2004 AND THIS 2012). I'VE DRIVEN MANUAL TRANSMISSION VEHICLES AND SPORTBIKES SINCE 1989 FROM TOYOTAS AND HONDAS TO VOLKSWAGENS TO SUZUKIS AND YAMAHAS AND I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THIS, NEVER EVEN BURNED OUT A CLUTCH, SO I CAN RULE OUT DRIVER ERROR. I PURCHASED THIS 2012 BRAND NEW AND HAD IT BUILD TO MY SPECIFICATIONS BECAUSE THERE WERE NO MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS AVAILABLE IN THE DEALER INVENTORY. I HAVE FOUND THAT 1000S OF OTHER JEEP OWNERS WITH MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS HAVE HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE, NARROWLY ESCAPING SERIOUS COLLISIONS WHEN THE CARS JUMP OUT OF GEAR AND LOSE POWER. JEEP LOVERS ARE LOYAL AND SUPPORT THE BRAND. IT WOULD BE NICE IF CHRYSLER WOULD BE LOYAL TO ITS CUSTOMERS AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE FLAWS IN THEIR MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS, RECALL THE OLD ONES AND CHANGE THE DESIGN OF THE NEW ONES BEFORE SOMEONE GETS SERIOUSLY HURT OR KILLED.",

I HAVE WASTED SO MUCH MONEY TRYING TO FIX THIS DANGEROUS STEERING PROBLEM. THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE. I HAVE GONE TO OTHER MECHANICS TO NO AVAIL BECAUSE THERE ARE NO JEEP SPECIALISTS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ALL PARTS CHANGERS.  I HAVE HAD THE ALIGNMENT DONE AT TWO DIFFERENT SHOPS EVERYTHING IS STRAIGHT. THERE IS SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG PLEASE DON'T BLOW THIS OFF,THIS IS A DANGER TO MY FAMILY AND OTHERS DRIVING AROUND THE JEEP.  *TR",

IT WAS TAKEN TO THE JEEP DEALERSHIP ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS (THAT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED) BECAUSE OF THIS DANGEROUS HAZARD, AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO REPLICATE SO IT WAS NEVER FIXED. I EVEN SHOWED THEM VIDEO EVIDENCE 3 TIMES. THE VEHICLE JUST STALLS RANDOMLY WHILE DRIVING (IN THE MIDDLE OF HIGH SPEED TRAFFIC). THE RPM WOULD JUST GO TO ZERO, AND WHEN TRYING TO START THE CAR BACK UP, IT WOULD TRY TO CRANK, BUT WOULD NOT START. THE CAR WOULD HAVE TO BE TURNED OFF FOR 5 MINUTES AND THEN THE CAR WOULD EVENTUALLY START AGAIN. THIS WOULD OCCUR AT LEAST 1/MONTH FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. THE JEEP DEALERSHIP REPLACED FUEL PUMP, AND CHECKED OTHER COMPONENTS AS THE ENGINE LIGHT NEVER TURNED ON, AND THEY COULD NOT FIND THE RESOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE. THIS IS A HIGHLY DANGEROUS PROBLEM AND SEEMS TO BE VERY COMMON AMONG THIS MODEL YEAR JEEP, AND JEEP CONTINUES TO CLAIM NO FAULT. SOMEONE COULD DIE IF THEIR CAR STALLED ON THE HIGHWAY WITH CARS GOING 70+ MPH. AN EXPERIENCED DRIVER MAY BE ABLE TO MANEUVER, BUT CERTAINLY AN INEXPERIENCED DRIVER WOULD NOT.

        "summary": "I PERSONALLY BELIEVE CHRYSLER IS HIDING INFORMATION ABOUT THE 2012 JEEP WRANGLER. THERE HAS JUST BEEN A RECALL FOR THE EXHAUST SYSTEM OF THE COMPASS, LIBERTY AND PATRIOT. IF ALSO APPLIED TO A SIMILAR EXHAUST SYSTEM ON MY WRANGLER I COULD HAVE AVOIDED A $1600 REPAIR FOR A NEW CATALYTIC CONVERTER. FURTHERMORE MY WRANGLER IS BURNING A QUART OF OIL EVERY 750 MILES. THIS IS A VERY TYPICAL PROBLEM ONLINE. CHRYSLER HAS TOLD ME THIS IS NORMAL FOR MY JEEP. AT THE DEALERSHIP I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE (LAHTI'S JEEP, LEOMINSTER), CHRYSLER WAS SUPPOSEDLY GOING DOWN TO LOOK AT THE SAME MAKE MODEL AND YEAR JEEP. LAHTI'S HAS TOLD ME THEY THINK CHRYSLER IS DODGING THEIR CALLS. NO MECHANIC HAS CONFIRMED THIS AMOUNT OF OIL CONSUMPTION IS OK. CHRYSLER TELLS ME ITS \"NORMAL.\" FINALLY, MY JEEP HAS JUST STARTED VIBRATING WHILE STOPPED (IN GEAR) WHILE HOLDING THE BREAKS. THE VIBRATING CREATES ONLY A SMALL RUMBLING NOISE BUT THE VIBRATIONS ARE VERY EVIDENT SITTING IN THE CAR OR HOLDING ONTO IT. CHRYSLER HAS REFUSED TO PUT ME IN CONTACT WITH A TECHNICIAN TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE BECAUSE I DO NOT PAY FOR THOSE SERVICES. APPARENTLY BUYING A 30,000 DOLLAR CAR DOES NOTHING BUT \"ALLOW YOU TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE.\" THE DEALERSHIP (ACTON CHRYSLER JDR) WAS UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE ISSUE DESCRIBED. CHRYSLER REFUSES OWNERSHIP OVER ANY OF MY AFOREMENTIONED ISSUES. THERE'S INHERENT ISSUES WITH THE DESIGN OF THIS VEHICLE. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CODES RECEIVED PROVIDE NO LOGICAL EXPLANATION OF THE VEHICLES ISSUES WHICH MAKES IT VERY HARD FOR THE DEALERSHIP TO DIAGNOSE. ALTHOUGH MY JEEP WRANGLER (YOU KNOW CHRYSLER'S TOP OF THE LINE VEHICLE) DRIVES ABSOLUTELY PERFECTLY FINE, IT CANNOT PASS INSPECTION WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT. THUS I AM FORCED TO LEAVE IT AT THE DEALERSHIP AS LONG AS THEY WANT TO CHARGE THE HIGHEST DIAGNOSIS FEE POSSIBLE. CHRYSLER NEEDS A BETTER REPAIR MANUAL AND SYSTEM UPDATES TO MAKE REPAIRS EASIER.",

I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP (RIVER OAKS JEEP IN HOUSTON) AND THEY DID NOT RETURN MY CALL. I HAVE ALSO SUBMITTED AN ONLINE REPORT. 2 DAYS AGO, THE JEEP AGAIN STALLED WHILE I WAS REVERSING OUT OF A DRIVEWAY. I PUT IT BACK INTO PARK FROM REVERSE AND RESTARTED IT. IT RESTARTED BUT WOULD NOT GO INTO GEAR. I THEN TURNED IT OFF AGAIN, RESTARTED AGAIN AND IT THEN WENT INTO GEAR AND ALLOWED ME TO GET OUT OF THE WAY OF ONCOMING CARS. THIS PATTERN OF STALLING, BEING UNABLE TO GO BACK INTO GEAR, REQUIRING TURNING IT OFF AND RESTARTING HAS BEEN RECURRENT AND HAS OCCURRED EXACTLY LIKE THAT ABOUT 8 TOTAL TIMES NOW. IT ADDITIONALLY WILL BE FULL OF GAS, GOING AT A CONSISTENT SPEED DOWN THE ROAD AND THE ENGINE JUST \"GIVES\" AND ALMOST FEELS LIKE IT PAUSES.

REFERENCE: PROBLEMS IN HEATING SYSTEM   TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,  I PURCHASED A NEW 2012 JEEP WRANGLER SPORT FROM HENDRICK CHRYSLER JEEP IN FAYETTEVILLE, NC. FOURTEEN MONTHS LATER, I MOVED TO FLORIDA, WHERE THERE WAS NO NEED TO USE THE HEATER. UPON MY RETURN TO NORTH CAROLINA IN THE WINTER OF 2014, I NOTICED THAT HEATER ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE WAS NOT AS WARM AS THE PASSENGER'S SIDE.   THE FOLLOWING WINTER, THE HEAT ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE FADED TO A POINT WHERE IT WAS BARELY WORKING. AFTER RESEARCHING THE ISSUE AND SPEAKING WITH A REPRESENTATIVE AT HENDRICK JEEP SERVICE CENTER, I LEARNED THAT THE HEATER CORE WAS LIKELY THE PROBLEM AND THAT I WOULD NEED TO FLUSH THE HEATER CORE. IN JANUARY 2015, I TOOK MY JEEP TO A PRIVATE MECHANIC TO HAVE THE HEATER CORE FLUSHED, WHICH FIXED THE PROBLEM FOR A SHORT TIME. RESEARCH ONLINE AMONG JEEP OWNERS OF MY MODEL AND YEAR REVEALED THAT THE LONG-TERM SOLUTION IS A NEW RADIATOR AND HEATER CORE (NEITHER OF WHICH ARE UNDER WARRANTY OR UNDER RECALL). THE POOR CLEANING AT THE TIME OF MANUFACTURING HAS  CAUSED THE CASTING OF SAND IN THE HEATER CORE AND RADIATOR, RESULTING BUILD UP THAT BLOCKS HEAT.  NOW, IN WINTER OF 2016, MY HEATER DOES NOT WORK. I CANNOT FIND A RECALL OR A REBATE FOR THE MORE THAN $2,400 DEALER ESTIMATE I RECEIVED TO REPLACE MY HEATER CORE AND RADIATOR. I FOUND A CHRYSLER STAR CASE (SEE ATTACHMENT) THAT GIVES STEPS TO FIX THE PROBLEM WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING ITS ORIGINS IN MANUFACTURING. I HAVE EMAILED CHRYSLER WITH A REQUEST FOR SUPPORT, TO NO AVAIL.   GIVEN THAT THIS PROBLEM IS SO WIDESPREAD AND CONSISTANT AMONG JEEP OWNERS OF MY MODEL AND YEAR, I WANTED TO SHARE THE CASE WITH THE RECALL AGENCY, ALTHOUGH I KNOW THIS IS NOT A DIRECT 'SAFETY ISSUE.'",

WILL IT TAKE A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT TO GET YOUR COMPANY TO FIX THE PROBLEM?

THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN WAS UNABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE TO RECREATE THE CODE, SO HE TOOK IT HOME FOR ABOUT 3 DAYS, FINALLY HAVING THE VEHICLE LOSE POWER AND WAS ABLE TO GET IT CODED.  THE DIAGNOSIS WAS A TIPM SHORTING OUT.  THERE WAS ALSO A DAMAGED CLOCKSPRING.  BOTH PARTS WERE REPLACED.  TOTAL OF BOTH INVOICES = $1,752.25.",

IT COST US $1100.00 TO REPLACE THE TIPM UNIT, WHICH WAS A HUGE FINANCIAL BURDEN ON US, BUT EVEN WORSE WAS THAT WE HAD TO GO WITHOUT THE JEEP (ONE OF OUR MAIN MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION) FOR ALMOST TWO MONTHS BECAUSE THERE'S A WAITING LIST FOR THE REPLACEMENT PART. WE CHECKED WITH 3 DIFFERENT REPAIR SHOPS JUST TO BE SURE, AND ALL SAID THE SAME THING: 1.) THAT THERE'S A WAITING LIST AT LEAST 40 PEOPLE LONG FOR THIS TIPM UNIT, AND 2.) THAT THEY'VE BEEN SEEING JEEP WRANGLERS LEFT & RIGHT FOR THIS SAME EXACT PROBLEM, AND THERE'S A WAITING LIST BECAUSE THE PART CAN'T EVEN BE MANUFACTURED QUICKLY ENOUGH TO KEEP UP WITH THE DEMAND. I KNOW THE TIPM UNIT HAS BEEN RECALLED FOR JEEP CHEROKEES, BUT WHY NOT JEEP WRANGLER WHEN THIS IS CLEARLY A MAJOR ISSUE FOR IT AS WELL??",

I DIDN'T BELIEVE THEIR STORY SINCE THEY INITIALLY TOLD ME THE TRANSMISSION OIL COOLER UNIT WAS FAULTY. THE BILL WAS 503 DOLLARS.     I AM E-MAILING YOU BECAUSE MY VEHICLE WAS ONLY LEAKING TRANSMISSION FLUID BECAUSE OF RECALL N28 AND THE DEALERSHIP TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME. THIS IS A CLASSIC \"DOUBLE DIP\" WHERE THE DEALERSHIP COLLECTS MONEY FROM FROM CORPORATE FOR THE RECALL AND THEN COLLECTS MONEY FROM THE CUSTOMER. THIS DEALERSHIP SHOULD BE UNDER INVESTIGATION AND AUDITED BECAUSE I AM MORE THAN CERTAIN THAT PEOPLE HAVE PREVIOUSLY BROUGHT IN VEHICLES TO GWINNETT JEEP FOR RECALL ISSUES AND THEN THEY CHARGED INNOCENT CUSTOMERS ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR \"ISSUES\" WITH DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE VEHICLE. I CHECKED THEIR REVIEWS AND THERE WAS A SIMILAR INCIDENT WITH A JEEP PERTAINING TO A DIFFERENT RECALL. I DON'T WANT THIS TO HAPPEN TO ANYONE ELSE IN THE FUTURE. I AM A FULL TIME STUDENT AND I ALSO WORK FULL TIME, SO MY TIME AND MONEY MEAN A LOT TO ME. A ROUTINE RECALL THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FREE OF CHARGE ENDED UP COSTING ME OVER 500 DOLLARS.   *JS",

BUT THEY WOULD NEVER DO THE INSPECTION).  THEN MY HUSBAND MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH LANDERS IN BOSSIER CITY LA TO HAVE THE RECALL WORK DONE... APPROXIMATELY A WEEK PRIOR TO THE APPOINTMENT THEY CANCELLED IT DUE TO BEING \"TOO BUSY\".  WE THEN RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE AUTOMATED APPOINTMENT LINE AND GOT RESCHEDULED FOR AN APPOINTMENT TODAY (AUG 4, 2014) AND WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE DEALER, WE WERE INFORMED THEY COULD NOT DO THE WORK BECAUSE AGAIN, THEY WERE \"TOO BUSY\" AND WE WERE INSTRUCTED TO CALL BACK ON AUG 11, 2014 TO SEE IF THEIR WORKLOAD HAD CLEARED UP AND IF THEY COULD GET US IN.  THE SERVICE ADVISOR EVEN TOLD US IT'S A2 HOUR JOB.  I THINK A RECALL SHOULD TAKE PRIORITY AND I SHOULD HAVE TO BATTLE 2 DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS FOR 9 MONTHS TO GET THIS DONE.",

THE HOOD HAS A DEEP WELL IN THE SHAPE OF A HORSE SHOE ...THE DESIGN IS A FLAW (REPLICATED FROM ANOTHER DESIGN FROM AEV BUT WHEN PUT INTO PRODUCTION THEY LEFT OUT DRAINAGE DESIGN) BECAUSE WATER ACCUMULATES ON THE HOOD WHILE WARM AND DRIVING IN SNOW ETC...WHEN SHUT DOWN THE WATER THAT REMAINS ON THE HOOD REFREEZES AND CAN NOT BE REMOVED UNLESS YOU CARE ABOUT DAMAGING THE PAINT BY FORCEFULLY CHISELING IT AWAY. LONG STORY SHORT I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY AND COULD SEE THAT THE ENGINE HEAT WAS MELTING THE ICE PANEL AND SURE ENOUGH IT FLEW UP AND OVER MY WINDSHIELD NOT WITHOUT SMASHING THE HEADER OF MY WINDSHIELD AND THEN NEAR MISSING THE VEHICLE THAT WAS IN BACK OF ME. THE DESIGN WILL DEFINITELY CAUSE DAMAGE IN THE FUTURE THIS I CAN SAY WITHOUT HESITATION. IF CHRYSLER HAD CHOSE THE OPTION TO VENT THE WATER OUT OF THE HOOD THERE WOULD BE NO PROBLEM. UNFORTUNATELY THEY DID NOT. NOW EVERY WINTER I PRAY THAT I AM NOT TRAVELING DURING HEAVY NEW ENGLAND WEATHER BECAUSE THIS ISSUE WILL REPEAT ITSELF AS MANY TIMES AS WE GET SNOW.  *TR",

TL* WHILE DRIVING ON A TWO LANE HIGHWAY AT 65 MPH WITH ONCOMING TRUCKS COMING BY, THE HOOD OF MY 2012 JEEP WRANGLER WOULD LIFT UP TO THE LIMITS OF THE HOOD LATCHES. THESE FACTORY LATCHES ARE MADE OF HEAVY DUTY RUBBER AND DO NOT HOLD THE HOOD DOWN/IN PLACE FIRMLY AS THE AIR FROM THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC PUSHES ON THE JEEP. THE HOOD CAN BE VISUALLY SEEN TO MOVE UPWARDS AND BOW WITH A LOUD BANG. I CONTACTED JEEP CHRYSLER AND WAS TOLD TO CONTACT THE DEALER (PRESTIGE CHRYSLER JEEP DODGE OF LAS VEGAS, NEVADA). I DID THIS AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BUT WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING SINCE IT WAS A CHRYSLER ISSUE AND THE DEALERSHIP COULD NOT DO ANYTHING UNDER WARRANTY. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT MOPAR HAS METAL LATCHES BUT I WOULD HAVE TO PURCHASE THEM. SINCE THIS IS A VERY SCARY SITUATION WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF THE HOOD BEING LIFTED BACK INTO THE WINDSHIELD, IT CAN HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS A DEADLY ACCIDENT. THIS IS DEFINITELY A DESIGN FLAW; I FEEL THAT THE NHTSA SHOULD MAKE CHRYSLER REPLACE THE HOOD LATCHES WITH THE STEEL ONES AT NO COST TO ME. THIS IS A VERY REAL PROBLEM AND NEEDS TO BE RECTIFIED BY THE NHTSA BECAUSE CHRYSLER WILL NOT LISTEN TO ME. I HOPE THAT SOMEONE AT THE NHTSA INVESTIGATES THIS BEFORE THERE IS A SERIOUS ACCIDENT AND SOMEONE IS KILLED.   UPDATED 11/14/12 *CN  UPDATED 11/14/2012 *JS   UPDATED 11/30/12 *CN",

IN ADDITION, THE RADIO WOULD JUST POWER OFF.  THE ONLY WAY IT WOULD COME BACK ON WAS TO HIT THE TOP OF THE DASH AND IT POWERED BACK ON.  TOOK IT IN AND THEY FLASHED A MODULE WHICH STOPPED THE WIPER ISSUE BUT NOT THE RADIO PROBLEM.  THIS WAS JULY 2012.  AFTER THAT IN SAME MONTH, I NOTICED AN ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON SOLID. TOOK IT IN, THEY RESET IT SAYING IT WAS A CYLINDER #2 MISFIRE.  PEOPLE ON WRANGLERFORUMS.COM WERE TALKING ABOUT IT TOO (SEE JK SECTION AND LOOK FOR \"TICKING PENTASTAR\" THREAD).  IT WAS THE BIGGEST THREAD ACTUALLY. APPARENTLY, OVER A HUNDRED OWNERS ON JUST THIS SITE ALONE HAD TO HAVE THEIR HEAD REPLACED. WTF?  THE LIGHT CAME BACK ON A COUPLE DAYS LATER SO I TOOK IT BACK IN.  THEY CONFIRMED THE SAME RESULT AND TOLD ME THEY WOULD ORDER A NEW HEAD.  THE LOCAL DEALER HERE IN SAVANNAH (HOOVER) TOLD ME IT WAS IN.  TOOK IN THE JEEP AND THEY SAID IT WOULD TAKE 2-3 DAYS.

WITH A MAJOR ISSUE LIKE THIS ON A BRAND NEW VEHICLE, THIS CALLS FOR A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT.  I GET SMALL GLITCHES HAPPENING BUT A NEW HEAD???
