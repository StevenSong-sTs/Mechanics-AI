There is never a time that it does not happen. I would be readily available to make my vehicle available for inspection of this concern.  Chrysler has issued recalls for this exact problem on several of their vehicle models all within the same time period of manufacturing.  The fuel tank inlet check valve is a widely known and dangerous issue that should be seriously considered to repair the remaining vehicles on the road with this problem. It has been documented by numerous owners of Jeep Wranglers from 2005-2006 while the same issue forced a recall of the same Jeeps in later model years, 2007-2008. The Jeep has been inspected by a certified mechanic where I was notified of much of this information.  With the amount of gasoline that spills out and the motorist re-enters their vehicle, there could be a static charge that could ignite the gasoline and cause extreme personal harm and property damage. There is no indication or warning sign to alert you that it is going to splash out gasoline. I am left to rarely fill my fuel tank to the maximum level to avoid being soaked in gasoline and irritating my skin or worse. I have owned this Jeep for going on 4 years and it has been a concern since day 1. I am noting this report of having been injured but the injuries at this point are only skin irritations as a result of gasoline coming in contact with our skin. I also noted the date as the first time this happened but as mentioned before, it happens or will happen at every fill up.",

ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ISSUE, IS THE DEFECTIVE SHIFTER TUBE SLEEVE NYLON INSERT THAT CRACKS.  THIS IS ALSO WELL DOCUMENTED ON THE JEEP FORUMS.    JEEP IS AWARE THAT BOTH PARTS ARE DEFECTIVE AND THEY SHOULD BE FORCED TO FIX THE PROBLEM FREE OF CHARGE FOR OWNERS.    PLEASE HELP!  *TR",

LETTERS WERE SENT TO DEALERS TO REPLACE THE DRIVE GEARS AND CAMS DAMAGED BY THIS PROBLEM. THE NOTIFICATION APPLIES TO THE 4.0 L ENGINE BUILT FROM OCT 20, 2004 TO FEB 1, 2005. MY LOCAL DODGE DEALER INFORMED ME THAT MY JEEP HAS AN OCT 9, 2004 BUILD DATE AND IS THEREFORE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE RECALL EVEN THOUGH THE PICTURES I SHOWED HIM OF THE DAMAGE TO THE GEARS IN MY ENGINE. THE DEALER SUGGESTED I TRY CUSTOMER SERVICE. THEY REFERRED ME TO NHTSA TO SEEK A RESOLUTION. SO AFTER INVESTING OVER $12,000 DOLLARS A MONTH AGO TO PURCHASE WHAT I EXPECTED WOULD BE A RELIABLE WINTER VEHICLE I INSTEAD HAVE A VEHICLE THAT SITS IN MY DRIVEWAY BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID TO DRIVE IT. IT CAN'T BE TRUSTED ON THE ROAD AND I CAN'T RISK USING IT AND FACING A $4,000.00 ENGINE REBUILD IF IT SEIZES. I NEED SOME HELP.   *TR",

I TOOK IT TO THE TIRE SHOP AND THEY INSPECTED THE TIE-ROD ENDS AND FOUND NO PROBLEM. IT WAS SHAKING SO BAD I THOUGHT THAT SURELY MY FRONT END WAS COMING APART SO, I GOOGLED MY PROBLEM AND WAS LED TO A PLETHORA OF INFORMATION AND FOUND THE TERM \"DEATH WOBBLE\", I THOUGHT IT FELT LIKE DRIVING OVER RAILROAD TRACKS, BUT DEATH WOBBLE SEEMS TO ALSO BE AN APPROPRIATE TERM AS WELL, BECAUSE THE FRONT END SEEMS TO BE SHAKING TO DEATH. I, LIKE SO MANY OTHERS, WENT TO KEVIN'S OFF ROAD, KOR, WEBSITE AND READ ABOUT THE POTENTIAL CAUSES AND CURES. IN MY PARTICULAR CASE THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY AFTERMARKET MODIFICATIONS, IT'S AS STOCK AS THEY COME. ANYWAY, KEVIN'S RECOMMENDED SOLUTION TO MY \"WOBBLE\" IS TO REPLACE THE TRACK BAR, THE STEERING DAMPER, CONTROL ARMS AND BUSHINGS. THE COST FOR THIS IS AROUND $366 FOR THE PARTS AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE LABOR COSTS WILL BE. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MAYBE SOMEONE AT CHRYSLER SHOULD ACTUALLY GO DRIVE ONE BEFORE THEY SAY \"IT'S NOT OUR FAULT\". THEY SHOULD BE PART OF THE SOLUTION SINCE THEY CREATED THE PROBLEM. MY 1989 JEEP DOESN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM, LEAF SPRINGS VS. INDEPENDENT COIL SPRINGS, PERHAPS,... A SMOOTHER RIDE BUT AT WHAT COST? $366 PLUS LABOR FOR ME.

THE LATTER PROBLEM SEEMED LIKE SOMETHING I COULD LIVE WITH BUT OVER TIME IT BECAME WORSE AND YOU COULD NO LONGER RELY ON THE CAR TO START.  JEEP HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY CAVALIER ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS, BUT THEY ARE REAL. MY CAR NOW HAS ONLY ABOUT 17,000 MILES ON IT BECAUSE OF THE RELIABILITY PROBLEM.

THEY COULDN'T REALLY FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEM, BUT CHARGED ME  FOR SOME REWIRING AND SENT IT BACK TO ME.  WITHIN DAYS, THE BATTERY WAS DEAD AGAIN, SO I BOUGHT A NEW BATTERY.   WITHIN DAYS, THAT BATTERY WAS DEAD AND THE CAR WAS AGAIN TOWED TO JEEP. THIS TIME, I FILED A FORMAL COMPLAINT WITH CHRYSLER, WHO ACCEPTED THE CASE.THE DEALER FIDDLED AROUND WITH THE CAR WITHOUT SUCCESS FOR A MONTH, BEFORE CHRYSLER AGREED TO ACCEPT MOST OF THE CHARGES FOR A COMPREHENSIVE REWIRING OF THE CAR.

THIS SEEMED ODD TO ME, THAT A DEALER WAS TELLING ME IT COULDN'T DO THE RECALL WORK ON A DANGEROUS CONDITION, SO I JUST HAD TO LIVE WITH IT. IN MARCH THE DEALER COMMENCED THE INTENSIVE REWIRING WORK, AND BY APRIL, THE DEALER SAID THAT THE PROBLEM HAD NOT YET BEEN RESOLVED, SO IT WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM CHRYSLER. THIS CARRIED ON INTO MAY, AND I STILL DID NOT HAVE THE CAR.  FINALLY, IN LATE MAY, THE DEALER CALLED AND SAID THEY \"THOUGHT THE CAR MIGHT BE FIXED\" BUT WEREN'T SURE, BECAUSE THE COMPUTER WAS STILL IDENTIFYING AN UNKNOWN DRAIN ON THE BATTERY WITH POTENTIAL ELECTRICAL SHORT IMPLICATIONS.

I TOOK IT TO THE SHOP AND HAVE HAD THE BRAKE PAD REPLACED, NEW SHOCKS, NEW ALIGNMENT, TIRES ROTATED, TIRES BALANCED, ROTORS REPLACED AND THE ENTIRE FRONT END CHECKED. THE SHAKING IS STILL PRESENT AND I CANNOT AFFORD TO KEEP REPLACING ONE THING AT A TIME WHEN NOTHING SEEMS TO HELP. THE VIOLENT SHAKING IS OCCURRING CONSISTENTLY EVERY TIME I REACH 52 MPH NOW AND I AM SCARED TO DRIVE IT ON THE INTERSTATE OR HAVE MY FAMILY DRIVE IT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, WHERE TO GO OR WHO TO TALK TO TO HELP ME GET THIS FIXED WITHOUT COSTING ME MY ENTIRE MONTHS SALARY OR MORE. MY TIRES ALSO APPEAR TO BE WEARING WRONG DUE TO THE SHAKING, WHICH WILL COST ME MORE MONEY TO REPLACE. I HAVE DONE RESEARCH ON THIS \"DEATH WOBBLE\" AND AM FINDING THAT IT IS VERY COMMON.

I TRIED OTHER STATIONS & OTHER TECHNIQUES LIKE FILLING SLOWER & TRYING TO ANTICIPATE WHEN THE TANK WOULD BE FULL & FILLING AS SLOWLY AS THE NOZZLE WOULD ALLOW. NOTHING SEEMED TO PREVENT THE SPIT BACK. I RECENTLY BECAME AWARE OF THE WORKINGS OF THE VAPOR CONTROL PROPERTIES OF MY JEEP. THAT LED ME TO AN INTERNET FORUM & TO THE FACT OTHERS ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. I ALSO SAW THAT THE NHTSA HAS INVESTIGATED THIS PROBLEM ON 2007 & 2008 WRANGLERS & THAT HAS LED TO CHRYSLER VOLUNTARILY EXTENDING THE WARRANTY ON THOSE GAS TANKS. HOWEVER, IN THEIR FINAL REPORT THE NHTSA (PE10-032) SEEMED CRITICAL OF THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS BECAUSE OF INTERNET EXPOSURE. IF THIS EXPOSURE LEADS TO IDENTIFYING MORE PEOPLE WITH LEGITIMATE COMPLAINTS, HOW IS THIS A BAD THING? THESE ASSERTIONS MAY BE EASILY VERIFIED BY A TRIP TO A FILLING STATION. PART OF CHRYSLERS RESPONSE WAS BASED ON WARRANTY CLAIMS, IT IS LOGICAL THAT THE OLDER & OUT OF WARRANTY VEHICLES WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN THEIR EVALUATION. I BELIEVE THAT EXTENDING THE WARRANTY RATHER THAN A RECALL IS A GOOD WAY OF HANDLING THIS (REPLACING ONLY THE TANKS WITH PROBLEMS) & I APPLAUD CHRYSLER FOR THIS. I HOPE YOU WILL ENCOURAGE CHRYSLER TO ADD THE 2004-2006 WRANGLERS TO THE EXTENDED GAS TANK WARRANTY PROGRAM AS WE ARE EXPERIENCING THE EXACT SAME ISSUE AS THE 07 & 08S ARE. THE FAIR ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE A SAFETY RECALL.  THE IDENTIFIED FAILURE SEEMS TO BE A CHECK VALVE IN THE GAS TANK.",

WHEN RESTARTED, THE VEHICLE RAN FINE, ALTHOUGH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  THE CODE WAS P0344.  WHEN THE CODE WAS CLEARED, IT DID NOT REAPPEAR.  HOWEVER, REVVING THE ENGINE TO 4500 RPM IN ALL GEARS EXCEPT REVERSE (N-1-2-3-4-5-6)  REPRODUCED THE ABOVE RESULTS WITHOUT FAIL.  ON MARCH 28, A REPLACEMENT CAMSHAFT POSITION SENSOR WAS ORDERED BY MYSELF, AND WAS INSTALLED ON APRIL 2.  AFTER THE INSTALL, REVVING THE ENGINE TO 4500 RPM ONCE AGAIN PUT THE VEHICLE INTO A \"LIMP MODE\". I MADE THE DECISION TO TAKE THE JEEP TO SOUTH POINT CHRYSLER DODGE JEEP IN AUSTIN, TX.  ON MAY 6, I WAS INFORMED THAT STANDARD DIAGNOSTICS COULD NOT FIND THE ISSUE, AND THE DEALER REQUESTED 4 HOURS OF TEAR-DOWN TIME TO INSPECT THE CAMSHAFT AREA FOR DAMAGE BASED ON RECOMMENDATIONS FROM CHRYSLER.  UPON APPROVAL, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE OIL PUMP GEAR AND CAMSHAFT WERE HEAVILY DAMAGED POSSIBLY DUE TO CAUSES OUTLINED IN NHTSA ITEM # 10013784.  WHEN CHRYSLER WAS CONTACTED FOR THIS, THEY INFORMED ME THAT, ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT THE VIN OF MY JEEP IS OUTSIDE OF THE VIN RANGE OF THE TSB, THERE WAS NO \"DEFINITIVE PROOF\" THAT THE OIL PUMP GEAR HAD DAMAGED THE CAMSHAFT AS OPPOSED TO VICE VERSA AND THEY WOULD BE UNABLE TO ASSIST IN THE REPAIR COST.

I BELIEVE THIS IS DUE TO THE DESIGN OF THE JEEP GAS TANK HAVING ONE OF THE TWO PRESSURE TUBES INVOLVING AN INNER TUBE THAT EXTENDS SEVERAL INCHES INTO THE TANK TO ATTEMPT TO EQUALIZE PRESSURE WHICH ACTUALLY CREATES AN AIR IMBALANCE THAT ALLOWS FOR FUEL TO SURGE BACK UP THE SPOUT DURING REFUELING WHEN THE FUEL FLOW INTO THE TANK IS STOPPED. *TR",

WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE I DID NOT PURCHASE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY.  I SPOKE TO CHRYSLER MOTORS CORP CUSTOMER CENTER (1-800-992-1997) (REF. #18329606) ON FEBRUARY 10, 2009 ABOUT THIS SAFETY ISSUE.  I AM REQUESTING THAT CHRYSLER REPAIRS THE GAS TANK FOR ME BECAUSE LIVES ARE AT DANGER WHEN THE VEHICLE IS FILLED UP WITH GAS AND GAS COMES OUT OF THE TANK.  GAS IS GETTING ON THE VEHICLE, MY HANDS AND THE GROUND AT THE PUMP.  ARMBRUSTER MOTOR CO. (1-800-766-0980) INFORMED ME ON FEBRUARY 6, 2009, THE ONLY WAY TO CORRECT THIS ISSUE WAS TO PURCHASE A NEW GAS TANK.  THE COST OF A NEW GAS TANK WOULD BE AROUND $500.00.  CHRYSLER TOLD ME THAT THEY WILL NOT PAY FOR A NEW GAS TANK BUT IF I PAY FOR THE NEW GAS TANK THEY WOULD COVER THE NEW TANK FOR 12 MONTHS OR 12,000 MILES.  I BELIEVE CHRYSLER SHOULD PAY FOR THIS REPAIR BECAUSE THEY DESIGNED THE FAULTY GAS TANK THAT WAS ORIGINALLY PLACED ON THE VEHICLE.  THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION WHEN I FILL MY VEHICLE WITH GAS.  IT IS NOT LIKE THE RADIO DOESN'T WORK, SPILLED GAS IS A FIRE HAZARD. *TR         THANK YOU,   JENNIFER WILLMAN",

THE CRACKS STARTED ON THE BOTTOM JUST OFF CENTER AND WENT UP ABOUT TWO INCHES AND THEN CURVED 90 DEGREES AND WENT HORIZONTALLY ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD.

THEY HAD SAFELITE AUTOGLASS PUT IN A NEW WINDSHIELD ON DECEMBER 27, 2007.    SIX DAYS LATER' ON JANUARY 2, 2008 ON MY WAY TO WORK THE WINDSHIELD CRACKED AGAIN WHILE DRIVING. THE REPLACEMENT WINDSHIELD WAS LESS THAN ONE WEEK OLD! THIS TIME THERE WERE THREE CRACKS. ONE WENT STRAIGHT UP FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE WINDSHIELD TO THE TOP, MOLDING TO MOLDING. THE OTHER TWO WERE SIMILAR TO THE FIRST TIME. THEY BEGAN AT THE BOTTOM, WENT UP TWO INCHES AND TURNED 90 DEGREES AND BECAME HORIZONTAL CRACKS. THE CRACKS COULD HAVE INITIATED FROM A SINGLE POINT BELOW THE MOLDING. THIS TIME THE CRACKS STARTED MORE TOWARD THE CENTER, ABOUT 4 INCHES CLOSER TO THE DRIVER SIDE THAN THE FIRST CRACKED WINDSHIELD.     THE AUTO GLASS TECHNICIAN SAID THAT CRACKED WINDSHIELDS ARE A COMMON PROBLEM WITH JEEP WRANGLERS. I HAVE READ ONLINE FORUMS AND A LOT OF JEEP OWNERS ARE HAVING THIS SAME ISSUE. ALSO, A CO-WORKER HAD THE SAME THING HAPPEN TO HIS JEEP. HE WENT THROUGH 2 WINDSHIELDS IN 3 YEARS. IT SOUNDS LIKE A SYSTEMATIC SAFETY ISSUE WITH JEEP WRANGLERS. I HOPE THAT JEEP WILL CORRECT THIS QUALITY DEFICIENCY BEFORE ANYONE GETS HURT. I CALLED THE JEEP CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY COULDN'T CORRECT THEIR DEFECTIVE VEHICLE.
