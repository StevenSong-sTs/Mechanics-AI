I CHECKED UNDER THE JEEP AND NOTICED THE REAR PASSENGER LOWER TRAIL ARM BROKE TOTALLY AWAY FROM THE FRAME DUE TO RUST. LOOKING ON FORUMS AND THE WEB READ ABOUT SAFETCAP AUTORUST FRAME SECTIONS. SO THINKING THIS MIGHT BE AN OPTION TO REPAIR IT ASKED A FRIEND THAT USED TO WORK AT A BODY SHOP TAKE A LOOK. HE TOOK A LOOK AND WAS SHOCKED HOW BAD THE JEEP WAS RUSTED FOR BEING A 2000. DIDN'T NOTICE UNTIL WE LOOKED AGAIN BUT THE SKID PLATE IS ALSO FALLING AWAY FROM THE FRAME. HE IS NOT SURE HE WOULD HAVE ANY GOOD METAL TO WELD TO AND ALSO SAID IT WILL BE LIKE DOMINOS THERE WILL BE MORE FAILED RUSTED PARTS UNDER THE JEEP LIKE BRAKE LINES ETC. FRIEND SAID SAFETY IS A HUGE CONCERN EVEN IF YOU WERE ABLE TO PATCH IT BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE FRAME AND COMPONENTS ARE RUSTED SO BAD. I DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES, KNOWLEDGE OR EXTRA MONEY TO THROW COUPLE GRAND AT IT AND REPLACE THE FRAME. SINCE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE HAS ANYONE HAD ANY LUCK COMMUNICATING THIS TO JEEP CHRYSLER DEALERS OR HEARD ANYONE THAT HAS? COUPLE OPTIONS I SEE NOW ARE TO PART IT OUT OR TRY TO SELL IT AS IT STANDS. ANY SUGGESTIONS? I NEVER WENT ON ANY ROUGH TRAILS BECAUSE IT WAS A PRIMARY VEHICLE. FOR A 2000 JEEP WRANGLER SPORT TJ THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE. DOES JEEP NOT TREAT THE FRAMES WITH RUST PROTECTION?

WE ARE ALSO HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM - IT WORKS OKAY, BUT IS MAKING THE ENGINE RUN SLUGGISH WHEN THE AIR IS ON. WE ARE ALSO HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE AUTO LOCKS - GRINDING NOISE - HAD TO TURN THE HORN OFF OR WOULDN'T WORK. IT'S JUST BEEN PROBLEM AFTER PROBLEM. I'M AFRAID TO DRIVE MY JEEP FOR LONG DISTANCES WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT I GOT IT FOR! I'M AFRAID TO DRIVE IT BECAUSE I AM WORRIED ABOUT THE SAFETY - ABOUT THE BRAKES GOING OUT!  *TR",

PURSUANT TO CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHERS WHO KNOW ME, THEY TOLD ME IT COULD PROBABLY BE REPAIRED INSTEAD OF REPLACED COSTING ME LESS.  A RADIATOR SHOP CONFIRMED THAT THE RADIATOR, HAVING A PLASTIC TOP, HAD TO BE REPLACED INSTEAD OF REPAIRED.  I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT NORMALLY RADIATOR PROBLEMS OCCURRED ON MUCH OLDER VEHICLES AND THAT MOST OLDER VEHICLES HAD ORIGINAL RADIATORS IN THEM EVEN IF THEY WERE REPAIRED.  MY COMPLAINT IS SIMPLE.   I THINK THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD NEVER HAVE PLACED A RADIATOR IN A VEHICLE WITH PLASTIC PARTS THAT CAN NOT BE REPAIRED ESPECIALLY ON A RADIATOR.  CHRYSLER'S USE OF RADIATORS WITH PLASTIC ON TOP ARE CAUSING THE RADIATORS TO LEAK EASIER/QUICKER THAN NORMAL AND THEY CAN NOT BE REPAIRED.  THEY MUST BE REPLACED.  THIS SEEMS TO BE JUST ANOTHER WAY FOR THEM TO GET CASH FROM CONSUMERS BY MAKING THEM REPLACE INSTEAD OF REPAIR.  MY JEEP HAS BEEN GARAGE KEPT SINCE I PURCHASED IT AND THE RADIATOR SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE REPAIRED OR REPLACED THIS SOON SINCE I HAVE TAKEN VERY GOOD CARE OF IT AND TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER FOR SERVICE AND REPAIRS.  I THINK HAVING PLASTIC ON RADIATORS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE PLACED IN ANY VEHICLE.  IT WEARS OUT QUICKER AND CANNOT BE FIXED.  REPLACEMENT COST IS MUCH GREATER THAN A REPAIR COST.  THANKS, CHRYSLER!  I WILL NEVER LOOK AT ANOTHER JEEP AS LONG AS THEY CONTINUE TO USE RADIATORS WITH PLASTIC PARTS.  *TR",

ON MY FOURTH & FIFTH TRIP, I DEMANDED WRITE-UPS. I HAVE SPOKEN WITH A CHRYSLER FACTORY REP WHO REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING, SINCE ON THE FIFTH TRIP, THE \"DEALER AGENT\" COULD NOT FIND THE PROBLEM. THE FACTORY REP DID SUBSEQUENTLY OFFER AN EXTENDED WARRANTY, BUT HAS NOT RETURNED MY CALLS. I HAVE FOUND THE WATER LEAK ON MY OWN AND ON MY SIXTH VISIT TO THE DEALER, I DEMANDED THAT THE BODY SHOP MANAGER VERIFY THE LEAKS. HE DID, AND I RECEIVED A \"WORK ORDER\" FROM HIM. I HAVE NOT TAKEN IT BACK A SIXTH TIME TO BE REPAIRED. I AM CONCERNED THAT THERE MAY BE ELECTRICAL OR OTHER PROBLEMS THAT MAY ARISE DUE TO THE LEAKAGE. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF I GET IT FIXED AGAIN AND IT LEAKS AGAIN, WILL THERE BE ANOTHER PROBLEM.
