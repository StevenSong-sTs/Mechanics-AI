Being on the freeway, doing 75, having my vehicle suddenly start shaking and wobbling like it's coming apart at the seams, and having to come to a complete stop in the middle of rush hour traffic, 3 lanes away from the shoulder has given me extreme anxiety! I have read in depth about this issue, I have read that there have been lawsuits and tech bulletins, but never a recall because \"nobody has died from this\". Believe me, it's only a matter of time, whether it be a heart attack or an accident, it will happen.",

On March 31 I wired  ($14, 995.00) to Loperena Auto. I hired a transportation company to transport the vehicle to my home address in Bedford NH - the vehicle arrived with a ripped temporary plate, 1 key, copies of Bill of Sale but NO TITLE.He informed me the title was coming (On April 20th still no title) and to relax. I ordered four new tires (as they were all bad and would not pass inspection) and they arrived a few days ago so I took the Jeep to Tire Warehouse and they said the vehicle has some issues and they recommended I take the vehicle to a mechanic. I texted Eddie from Lopererna who informed me that this was a used vehicle and he does not check anything in his cars including brakes, engines nothing - this was a completely different tune than when I spoke with him before when he said nothing was wrong with the vehicle. He then called me a text gangster, so I called him and became belligerent and asked me if I knew who I as dealing with and come down to the dealership.I told him the car needed work which was different than what he told me on the phone before purchasing the vehicle and he again said he never checks his cars.. they are used cars. I took the vehicle to my local mechanic and he said the car was a lemon. The car needs new front bearings, two new U joints and if they are stuck to the front axle then a new front axle, rear axle seal and additional bearings. He then said there is so much OIL on the engine that it is a fire hazard (Must not be Driven)  and he cannot determine where the oil is coming from without pressure washing the Engine but at a minimum the whole engine needs to be resealed.   Answers: Engine, Tires and Axle failed inspection and yes. Definite safety risk! Inspected by mechanics and police. NO Lights at all and only made aware at mechanics shop",

This issue is common and described across the web but is a safety hazard! The headlights will flash 3-5 times then completely shut off. Restarting the Jeep and disconnecting the battery does not help. Jeep dealer says circuit in the TIPM is the issue and that this is common! Lordy have mercy for all the vecs on the road when my headlights started flashing at them and then went out on, of course,  an unlit section of the road. But the crazier part is Jeep knew this could happen and doesn't warn the customers. I sure  did not know that I might be driving blind at night becoming a safety hazard. The lights then decide to not work for a few days before going back to being reliable for anywhere from weeks to months until you happen to drive at night again and bam they go out again. Luckily the runner/ fog lights are unaffected but as a primary vehicle I can not just keep taking ubers every time it is dark outside! This is such a serious safety issue to loose your lights while driving! There are two common fixes for this. One you buy the TIPM or two you buy non stock headlights and reroute them to your own switch but for most of us, buying a part that Jeep knows will break is crazy and not practical (plus WE the consumer didn't know it would) and the alternative of having to buy a different company's lights to buy pass the wiring in just crazy.  It is such a serious issue I do not understand why there is no recall! I'm also so unsure if I can even pass a safety inspection anymore.    Also the automatic fuel stopper does not work which is ANOTHER know glitch with the TIPM. This is okay if you know about it because you can hold the handle the whole time while filling up but you can not trust it alone. It isn't like it is all the time either. Just enough to keep you on your toes and plosion the ground with spillage. The first time is scary though.",

MY JEEP HIT A DIP AND SHOOK SO UNCONTROLLABLY I ALMOST HAD TO DO A COMPLETE STOP ON THE FREEWAY. I TRIED THE BEST I COULD TO MERGE TO THE SLOW SPEED LANE TO POSSIBLY EXIT THE FREEWAY. A FEW VEHICLES WERE BEHIND ME WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND IT ALMOST CAUSED A SEVERE ACCIDENT.  IT LITERALLY FEELS LIKE THE AXEL IS GOING TO SNAP IN HALF OR THE VEHICLE MAY EVEN FLIP IF THE SHAKING WERE TO CONTINUE.

THE HEADLIGHTS WOULD SHUT OFF WHEN I SHUT THE JEEP OFF AND REMOVED THE KEY, SO I DEALT WITH THE PROBLEM FOR A FEW DAYS UNTIL IT WENT AWAY ON ITS OWN. I'M HOPING THIS IS THE LAST OF MY TIPM ISSUES.",

IT WAS HARD TO STEER, BUT I WAS MOVING SLOW. I THOUGHT IT WAS A WEIRD FLUKE. I PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND RESTARTED IT WITH NO PROBLEM. THE SECOND TIME IT MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING, WE HAD JUST PULLED OUT OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE JEEP STALLED. THE BREAKS DON'T WORK WELL, AND THE STEERING IS DIFFICULT. HE PUT THE JEEP IN NEUTRAL AND RESTARTED IT WITH NO PROBLEM. THE THIRD TIME IT HAPPENED, WAS ON JANUARY 10, 2015. I WAS DRIVING AT NIGHT WITH MY CHILD ON A LONG TRIP. I HAD BEEN DRIVING THE JEEP FOR SEVERAL HOURS ON THE INTERSTATE.  IT HAPPENED AT AROUND 10:00 PM - IT WAS VERY DARK. I WAS IN THE PASSING LANE GOING ABOUT 65 MPH WHEN THE ENGINE STALLED, THE HEADLIGHTS WENT OUT, ALL THE INTERIOR LIGHTS WENT OUT, DASHBOARD WENT DARK, AND I KNEW FROM THE PREVIOUS TWO TIMES, THAT IF I APPLIED THE BREAKS OR TRIED TO STEER, IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT. I DECIDED THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK DOWN AND TRY TO FIND NEUTRAL AND ACCIDENTALLY PUT IT IN A LOW GEAR. SO I TURNED THE IGNITION SWITCH AND EVERYTHING CAME BACK ON (ENGINE, LIGHT INSIDE AND OUT, POWER STEERING, AND POWER BREAKS) WHILE THE JEEP WAS IN DRIVE TRAVELING AT 65 MPH. I TOOK IT TO THE JEEP DEALER TO HAVE IT REPAIRED. THEY TOLD ME THAT THE TRANS RANGE SENSOR WENT BAD. MY MAIN CONCERN IS - WHY IS THE ENGINE STALLING AND JEEP LOSING ALL POWER WHILE MOVING WHEN THE SENSOR GOES BAD? THERE WAS NO WARNING LIGHT TO LET ME KNOW A SENSOR WAS BAD. ARE  ALL JEEPS DESIGNED WITH THIS SENSOR, AND WILL ALL JEEPS EXPERIENCE THE SAME THING IF THEIR TRANS RANGE SENSOR GOES BAD, OR WAS IT JUST SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED WITH MY SPECIFIC VEHICLE?   *TR",

I EXPLAINED  HOW IT WAS ALL RUSTED & I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT. THIS SHOULD BE RECALLED FOR RUSTING OUT.

APPROXIMATELY 2 MILES IN WE HEARD A LOUD NOISE, STOPPED THE VEHICLE AND DISCOVERED THAT THE FRONT AXLE HOUSING WAS CRACKED. CHRYSLER'S ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE WOULD NOT RECOVER TEH VEHICLE FROM THE TRAIL SO WE GOT IT TO A MAINTAINED ROAD.  SEVERAL DAYS LATER WE HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO OUR JEEP DEALER FOR INSPECTION.

VERBALLY WE WERE ALSO TOLD THAT WE WERE NOT USING THE VEHICLE FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSE.  WE SUBMITTED PHOTOS AND NARRATIVES OF SIMILIAR INCIDENTS (FRONT AXLE HOUSING BREAKS DURING DURING MILD OFF-ROAD DRIVING, AND ONE INSTANCE OF HITTING A CURB WITH THE TIRES).  THESE WERE REGARDED AS INCIDENTS OF EXTREME OFF-ROADING AS WELL.  SINCE THE BREAKAGE OCCURRED AFTER SEVERAL MILES OF TRAVEL ON MAINTAINED HIGHWAY, AND THEN APPROXIMATELY 15 MILES ON MILD OFF-ROAD TRAILS THAT DID NOT REQUIRE 4WD WE WILL REPLACE THE ENTIRE AXLE WITH AN AFTERMARKET PRODUCT THAT IS SIMILIAR IN COST.  OUR CONCERN IS THAT AS WE RESEARCH ONLINE WE ARE FINDING SIMILIAR INCIDENTS UNDER SIMILIAR CONDITIONS - FRONT AXLE HOUSING BREAKS IN THE SAME LOCATION WHEN THE VEHICLE IS UNDER ONLY SLGHTLY HIGHER THAN NORMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS ON 2007-2010 JEEP WRANGLER JK UNLIMITED RUBICONS.

WHEN I CONTACTED CUSTOMER SERVICE AT JEEP THEY STATED I NEEDED TO FILE A CLAIM THROUGH MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD ASSIST ME WITH. A CLAIM WAS FILED THROUGH MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND CHRYSLER COMPANY. CURRENTLY THE JEEP IS BEING REPAIRED THROUGH MY INSURANCE COMPANY. I FEEL THAT ONCE THE BODY WORK IS COMPLETE ON MY JEEP THE MECHANICAL PARTS OF THE JEEP WILL STILL BE DEFECTIVE. I AM CONCERNED THAT THE PARKING BRAKE WILL FAIL AGAIN AND COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DAMAGE PROPERTY OR A BYSTANDER. CHRYSLER SENT OUT A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR, HANK SULLIVAN, WHO INSPECTED THE PARKING BRAKE.

WE HAVE A 6 MONTH OLD, 2010, JEEP WRANGLER, 2-DOOR, MANUAL TRANSMISSION.  IMMEDIATELY AFTER PURCHASING THE VEHICLE, THE CLUTCH BEGAN POPPING OUT OF FIRST AND SECOND GEAR. LAST MONDAY, SEPT. 20TH, WE HAD A CHRYSLER DEALER LOOK AT THE ISSUE AND THE TECHNICIAN TOOK APART THE TRANSMISSION AND REPLACED A SNYCHRONIZER.  ONCE WE TOOK THE VEHICLE HOME, WE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO HAVE FURTHER PROBLEMS.  NOW, THE VEHICLE OFTEN STICKS IN GEAR AND WE OFTEN CAN'T GET IT INTO THE NEXT HIGHEST GEAR OR DOWNSHIFT.  FOR EXAMPLE, I PULLED OUT OF A PARKING LOT (WITH MY 6 YEAR OLD SON AS A PASSENGER AS WELL), AND I GOTTHE VEHICLE  SHIFTED (HAD TO JAM IT) INTO FIRST, BUT COULDN'T GET IT INTO 2ND.  WE WERE STUCK IN ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND I WAS DESPERATELY TRYING TO GET IT INTO A GEAR TO GO.  I ENDED UP GETTING IT INTO THIRD AND PUTTED SLOWLY IN MY LANE.  ALSO, I WAS ON MY WAY TO A MEETING, WITH A CO-WORKER, AND I WAS ATTEMPTING TO PUT THE VEHICLE INTO 5TH AND IT WOULDN'T GO INTO 5TH GEAR, I HAD TO SLOW DOWN IN A HIGHER MILEAGE AREA TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO KEEP IT IN 4TH.  THOSE ARE TWO OF SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF INCIDENCES THAT TOOK PLACE OVER A PERIOD OF 5 DAYS.  WE HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR.  AT THIS POINT, THERE HAS BEEN NO DECISION ON WHAT REPAIR WILL TAKE PLACE.  THE TECHNICIAN IS ATTENDING A TRANSMISSION TRAINING TODAY AND STATED HE WOULD CONSULT OTHERS THERE.  HOWEVER, A SERVICE MANAGER STATED THAT THIS IS THE THIRD JEEP WRANGLER THAT THEY HAD TRANSMISSION ISSUES WITHIN TWO WEEKS AND THAT CHRYSLER IS AWARE OF THESE PROBLEMS.  I HAVE GROWN VERY FRUSTRATED AND CONCERNED WITH THIS VEHICLE.  I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT IS MY PRIMARY MODE OF TRANSPORTATION WITH MY CHILD AND BEING STUCK IN ONCOMING TRAFFIC IS NOT AN IDEAL SITUATION.
