Jeep 4xe: after coming to a complete stop or just slowing down and entering a lower gear, has a 1-2 second delay in the accelerator. Has caused tires to squeal when accelerator started to respond. Have almost caused accidents when becoming unresponsive as the vehicle will move forward but lose accelerator power. This happens infrequently and spontaneously which makes it impossible to plan for/ drive defensively against, cannot replicate or force it to happen. Vehicle can be inspected upon request. How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk? Vehicle will move forward after stopping, such as an intersection, and suddenly does not increase for 1-2 seconds making me a hazard to traffic. This happens maybe 1-3x a week and is impossible to replicate. Have been almost rear ended many times as no brake lights appear when this happens. Have almost been t-boned by oncoming traffic because of the delay. Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? No. Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others? Vehicle has had engine repaired and inspected by dealership. Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear? No.",

My vehicle (2023 4Xe with 5000 miles) losses acceleration power\u2026 This has happened at least 10x over the past 5 months. The check engine light often flashes on and off or stays on steady during this. When engaging the gas pedal at various speeds (30-65MPH) the gas fails to respond or output any power causing the vehicle to slowdown dramatically.  SIGNIFICANT risk of being crashed into. It takes flooring the gas pedal and anywhere from it 10-25 seconds for the power to kick back in / engage and accelerate.  I have been trying to get this fixed since August. One Jeep dealership (had my vehicle for 36 days) replicated the issue but got \u2018no code\u2019 therefore they could not fix.  Since the 24V720000 / 95B was announced 2 months ago no Jeep dealership (I have contacted over 18) will even attempt to investigate or fix this issue as they claim its related to the battery recall 24V720000 / 95B.

The recall highlights a critical defect in the High Voltage (HV) battery, which poses a severe risk of fire due to internal cell damage caused by defective components. While I understand that FCA US LLC is working on a remedy, I have not been provided with a clear timeline for repairs, leaving me in a highly unsafe and uncertain situation. The fact that the recall advises against charging the vehicle and even recommends parking it away from structures and other vehicles emphasizes the magnitude of the fire hazard. This creates a significant inconvenience and renders the vehicle virtually unusable for its intended purpose. I no longer feel comfortable driving or even owning this vehicle, as the defect jeopardizes my safety, the safety of others, and my property. The lack of immediate resolution places me in a position where I am unable to confidently rely on this vehicle without fear of a catastrophic event. I urge the NHTSA to intervene and ensure that FCA US LLC provides a timely resolution, including exploring options for replacement or refund, as this defect makes the vehicle a danger to myself and the community. Given the serious nature of this recall, I feel that no consumer should be left waiting without an actionable solution while exposed to such a critical safety risk.",

This defect represents a severe safety hazard that jeopardizes the safety of my family, property, and others.  Details of the Issue:  The recall was issued due to a defect in the hybrid powertrain that could result in a fire, even when the vehicle is parked and turned off. Jeep/Stellantis has advised owners to: \u2022Refrain from charging the vehicle. \u2022Park it away from structures and other vehicles.  This advisory alone highlights the gravity of the issue, rendering the vehicle unsafe to use as intended.  Steps Taken to Remedy:  \u2022I have contacted my dealership and Stellantis to schedule a repair; however, no remedy has been made available to date. \u2022It has become clear that Stellantis is unable to provide a timely or effective solution to fix this safety-critical defect.  Lemon Law Qualification:  California Lemon Law, under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, provides protections for substantial defects that impair the use, value, or safety of a vehicle. The following criteria are met: 1.Substantial Safety Defect: A fire risk qualifies as a substantial defect that threatens the safety of occupants and property. 2.Reasonable Repair Attempts: Despite the recall, Stellantis has not resolved the issue, and the vehicle remains unusable for its intended purpose. 3.Unresolved Issue: My vehicle has been effectively out of service due to safety concerns, and Stellantis has been unable to provide a timeline for resolution.  Request for Buyback:  Given the seriousness of this defect and the inability to remedy it, I am requesting that Stellantis initiate a buyback under California Lemon Law. A fire risk is not an issue to delay or hope for a fix\u2014it demands immediate resolution.

The recall highlights a critical defect in the High Voltage (HV) battery, which poses a severe risk of fire due to internal cell damage caused by defective components. While I understand that FCA US LLC is working on a remedy, I have not been provided with a clear timeline for repairs, leaving me in a highly unsafe and uncertain situation. The fact that the recall advises against charging the vehicle and even recommends parking it away from structures and other vehicles emphasizes the magnitude of the fire hazard. This creates a significant inconvenience and renders the vehicle virtually unusable for its intended purpose. I no longer feel comfortable driving or even owning this vehicle, as the defect jeopardizes my safety, the safety of others, and my property. The lack of immediate resolution places me in a position where I am unable to confidently rely on this vehicle without fear of a catastrophic event. I urge the NHTSA to intervene and ensure that FCA US LLC provides a timely resolution, including exploring options for replacement or refund, as this defect makes the vehicle a danger to myself and the community. Given the serious nature of this recall, I feel that no consumer should be left waiting without an actionable solution while exposed to such a critical safety risk.",

When I questioned that a similar issue occurred when the vehicle was brand new and the plug needed to be changed and the whole hybrid system was disabled for 5 months while waiting for the part, the tech/manager continued to assess the car and stated the hybrid battery needs to be changed and the car cannot be driven.

I had no ability to accelerate but steering was still enabled and allowed me to pull over to the side of the road to investigate. Fortunately I was being followed by another member of my family and they provided a bit of a roadblock to allow us to navigate the traffic. At the time power was lost, the console had several warning lights including the check engine light, multiple battery system lights and others. After shutting the Jeep off, it started up again normally as if nothing had happened. I called the dealer who basically said they couldn't reproduce the issue but it had happened to others and clears on its own. Additionally, up to this point, the Jeep had several times been unable to charge in the warm summer weather with error messages Check Charging System and the Check Engine Light which I was able to clear with an OBDII scanner.

On [XXX], while the vehicle was charging at [XXX], it caught fire. The vehicle had no pending services or recalls at the time of the incident.  To my further dismay, in October 2024, Jeep issued a global recall for this model, citing battery issues. This only confirms my suspicion that the fire in my vehicle was the result of a manufacturing defect. Given the timing of the recall, I believe my incident is directly related to this defect, and the issue raises significant safety concerns.  The total cost of my vehicle was approximately $78,454, and I have only driven it for about 15,000 miles. After filing an insurance claim, I was offered $45,215, which does not adequately cover the financial loss I have incurred. This leaves me at a significant financial deficit. Additionally, I have been renting a car for the last six weeks due to this incident, which has further cost me approximately $36,000.  I have contacted Jeep\u2019s customer support and created a case (number: [XXX]), but despite my efforts, I have yet to receive any meaningful response or resolution from Jeep. This situation has caused not only significant financial strain but also immense mental stress.  I urge the NHTSA to investigate this issue thoroughly and ensure that Jeep takes responsibility for their defective vehicles. I am seeking compensation that appropriately reflects the financial losses I have suffered, ideally in the form of either a replacement  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

A vehicle fire can result in increased risk of occupant injury and/or injury to persons outside the vehicle, as well as property damage. Vehicle risk is reduced when the battery charge level is depleted. Accordingly, owners are advised to refrain from recharging. Out of an abundance of caution, FCA US is also advising owners of these vehicles to park away from structures or other vehicles until the remedy is obtained. The vehicle is available for inspection upon request. There is an open recall on the defect, however there is no remedy currently available. Due to the severity of the defect and the inability to use the vehicle as intended, including safely parking the vehicle or recharge the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, I believe the terms of my lease agreement have been breached by Chrysler and I wish to return the vehicle and terminate the lease without penalty.",

        "summary": "On July 15th , July 30th and  August 11th 2024 the gas pedal on my less than 2 month old Jeep Wrangler 4xE did respond / engage while driving and pressing on the pedal. It felt like the car was dying. This happened at three different speeds, 65mph on the highway, 30mph on a side road and around 40mph on a state road. In addition to the gas pedal not working/ vehicle not moving forward the vehicle also seemed to slow it self down, like i was breaking however i was not and as the vehicle slowed down it was shaking vigorously all 3 times. This is incredibly dangerous and unsafe. I contacted over 20 jeep dealerships and jeep corporate before I was able to get an appointment - this vehicle was looked at by a dealership and I have been told they 'have no codes' and 'everything is fine'   In addition to the loss of power, gas failure, non responsive gas pedal I have counted over 10 incidences where this vehicle has a delay in acceleration of 3 - 8 seconds before lurching and jerking forward at various speeds, some of the times vehicle has also shaked other times the jerking is so severe if feels like you've been rear ended.   Jeep is not taking these concerns seriously, I am reporting in hopes that you will and maybe others have reported similar issues and we can get some answers and repairs figured out as this car is unsafe and I do not want me or my children to be a statistic of a horrible accident that should have been a recall / fix issued by jeep.",

        "summary": "My husband was going 65mph on the highway in e-save mode with ~1% battery and 3/4 tank of gas. The \u201cservice charge system\u201d error popped up with other red errors on the sides and the uconnect also posted an error. He described the incident as it felt like the transmission was failing. He coasted off the highway, thankfully safely, and put it in park. Then it died. He powered it back on and tried to put it back in e-save and it said e-save not available. He started driving again as he was making the journey to pick up our son from camp. An hour later, while back on the 3 lane highway, he experienced the exact same thing, this time having to pull off to the side of the interstate. At this point, he was not comfortable continuing the drive in this unreliable and unsafe car, and had it towed. Furthermore, we didn\u2019t feel safe putting our kids in the back of a car that stops on you at high speeds.   Fast forward to the next day, the dealer called and they told me nothing was wrong with the vehicle. I immediately called Jeep cares. 3 business days later, Jeep Cares called back and said they are not willing to buy back our vehicle but will have it towed 190 miles to a dealer that is closer to our house. This shows me that they are 100% aware of this issue but don\u2019t want to lose their shirt on this car. I refuse to drive it now, especially with my kids. Hoping the dealership next to us is actually able to recreate the issue and figure out next steps.",

        "summary": "On three separate occasions, the vehicle I own has suffered from a complete loss of power during operation.   The initial incident (09/02/2023) occurred shortly after merging onto the westbound lane of Highway 71. Without warning, the vehicle ceased to function, coming to an immediate and forceful stop that nearly resulted in a collision with other vehicles traveling at approximately 60 MPH. The vehicle was rendered immobile, with the wheels locked as if in gear, necessitating its removal via a flatbed tow truck. The dealership was unable to restore the vehicle\u2019s functionality and ultimately replaced the Electronic Control Module (ECM).   The second incident (03/08/24) involved a similar sudden loss of power while traveling on Highway 1. This failure resulted in a total loss of power, including both power-assisted brakes and steering, eliminating my ability to signal to other drivers as the vehicle drifted. I was forced to maneuver across three lanes of traffic to reach the safety of the roadside. After several attempts, the vehicle eventually restarted.   The most recent occurrence (05/13/2024) mirrored the previous incidents, with the vehicle losing all power and leaving me stranded on the side of Highway 71.   Given these repeated and unpredictable malfunctions, which pose a severe risk to safety and severely hinder the normal operation of the vehicle, I am no longer willing to allow my son to drive this vehicle. I firmly believe these issues constitute a significant and life-threatening safety hazard.",

Slowed down to 50 and it stopped.  I was terrified I was going to crash.  It happened several more times during the same trip, whenever over 55 mph.  Brought to dealer on 11/27/2023.  Dealer says Stellantis is aware of the issue -- and has been sued for it in the past -- but it's been 4 months and Stellantis has not yet provided the replacement part.  This is a brand new vehicle with about 4,000 miles on it, and the death wobble continues to occur whenever over 55 mph.  Infuriating that Stellantis is aware of this issue yet is still installing malfunctioning parts.",

        "summary": "When driving the vehicle at 60mph or faster, the steering wheel will begin to shake uncontrollably and continue to rattle for approximately 30 seconds until the vehicle is reduced speed to about 40mph or less.  If I resume speed again, the shaking vibrations will continue to happen repeatedly.   This puts my safety at risk when I attempt to drive on the freeway and approach the speed limit and causes me to reduce my speed to an unsafe speed far lower than the flow of traffic on the freeway.  In addition, while the vehicle is vibrating/shaking, there is a lack of control of the vehicle and puts the driver in a panic state, because it feels like a flat/blown tire at such a high speed.    The vehicle was taken into the dealership and they would not check the problem until I paid for an alignment maintenance fee of over $300.  Therefore, I proceeded with the costs and they discovered some parts that need to be replaced by the factory.  In spite of this, the dealership is holding me responsible for the process of elimination charges because the extended warranty XF1 and recall V41 are not attached to my VIN on this vehicle.  However, these recalls are attached to vehicles made on or before November 2020 and my vehicle was built November 2022.    I am aware of this issue, because my prior jeep wrangler vehicle was a 2019 and I experienced the same safety issues, and I brought it in and found out about the recall issued and it was repaired for my safety.  However, the same safety issues are occurring in my 2023 jeep wrangler with only 25,000 miles on it, but no recalls are attached to my VIN to assist with the problem.   Each time the vehicle malfunctions there is no warning lamps, no messages or any other symptoms of the problem prior to failure. The incident first started to appear around 2/2/2024 & continued to happen more frequently with time.  I scheduled the repair at the jeep dealership on 2/27/2024 and they currently still have my vehicle for this malfunction.",

It reduced speed immediately and went into a \"coasting mode\" almost causing the car behind me to rear-end me. I immediately put on my hazard lights and was attempting to turn the corner to pull it into the parking lot when my steering column seized and the vehicle shut off completely.  There were warning lights on the instrument panel, however, I was unable to focus on what they were as I was in sheer panic mode trying not hit or be hit by the sudden shut down of my vehicle. The only warning I can recall was to put the car in park, which I was unable to do because I was in the middle of the road, with no area to pull over too.  I have owned my vehicle for just over two months and at the time of the incident this evening the vehicle has 2, 727 miles,  1/2 tank of gas, the battery voltage was normal and it had a small amount of charge.   I have read numerous articles stating, including one from NHTSA, that the recall does not affect my jeep as it was manufactured in Oct. 2022.  This is incorrect information and if anyone had bothered to do any investigations would find that there are hundreds of complaints on Jeep forums for Jeep Wrangler 4xe's manufactured AFTER the 8/17/22 having this problem. The bigger issue is that there is NO RECALL for the issue because it is past the \"end\" date for the recall. THIS VEHICLE IS DANGEROUS!!

I have not had a vehicle since March and according to Jeep, the \"fix\" is still in an engineering and design phase which could take months/years. There was a class action lawsuit and Jeep asked to have the lawsuit dropped if they did a voluntary recall. Well, now it feels like since they are not under a lawsuit, they can take their time with the recall. Who can help push Jeep into getting this thing done? Thank you.",

At the time my Jeep Wrangler 4XE was operating in Hibrid mode running on electric with 49% charge left. As my Jeep came to a stop the gasoline engine started and the Jeep lunged forward striking the vehicle in front of me pushing it approximately 3 feet back before coming to a stop.   This action caused significant damage to the other vehicle and minor damage to my jeep.    I believe it was the abrupt start of the gasoline engine that caused the jeep to lunge forward even though my foot was on the brake.  This action put me and others at risk, it was fortunate that the othe vehicle was unoccupied.  I have contacted Jeep thru online email concerning this accident but at this time have not received a response.  The police department was contacted and an officer responded to the scene.  The officer observed the damage to both vehicles and did file an accident report.  There were no warning lamps, warnings, or other symptoms of a problem prior to this incident.",

The following fault codes wers pulled via obdii: U0001, U0151, U0155, U017E, U0418, U1442. Each code related to a malfunction with \"CAN BUS C\" or what the dealership referred to as a \"star connector\".  After further research it is apparent that this part has continued to fail on many jeep wranglers dating back to 2018 and every report I have seen the person has stated the same issue of losing power steering. My jeep is a 2023 and now needs this part replaced. Why hasn't there been a recall on these vehicles for this faulty part? Why does chrysler continue to use these faulty parts on current vehicles when they know of their failure rate? This is a serious safety issue and should have been addressed years ago.

There is a safety issue with the 2023 where the vehicle programming causes the engine to rev itself to around 2,800 RPM's upon a cold start. This is after the engine has warmed up to operating temperature at idle. So the safety complaint is that as I begin to drive the vehicle in a parking lot with pedestrians in it, the vehicle will auto rev while in gear causing excessive and unsafe speeds in that situation. My identical 2020 Jeep Wrangler does not and never has done this. I strongly suspect that this is an emissions compliance programming issue with the software to heat up the catalytic convertor. Whatever their reasoning for doing this it's still an unsafe vehicle feature, one that multiple other owners have stated that they are having the same issue. I have reached out to FCA to no avail, case# 86685993. I do look forward to hearing from you and hope that with your assistance we can get this safety issue figured out. Thank you!",

This resulted in an immediate, large radial crack and approximately 9 inch lateral crack across my windshield. The rock was traveling slow enough that I could see it coming. Further research shows that this is a known issue to the manufacturer and owners, which is why the manufacturer offers an upgraded glass option for durability. This makes sense for off-roading or in a way inconsistent with manufacturers recommendation, but it is a safety issue if the glass cannot maintain during normal operation. I have concerns with every rock until it is replaced. It has been inspected by manufacturer/dealer, and I am paying to have it upgraded and replaced. However, I have concerns that it may result in injuries in event of a crash, or just in the course of normal operation.

This is the first time I opened the back trunk and saw this.  Filed a manufacturer warranty claim at the dealership on 6/26/2023. Jeep denied the claim. I find this situation unacceptable as the fiberglass hard-top is cracking and falling apart and the crack is widening as we drive the vehicle.  I need help as both the dealership and the manufacturer are not fixing the manufacturing defect and are using delaying tactics.

I contacted Jeep and they sent Engineering Analysis Associates/Bosch Automotive Service Solutions out to examine the car and they said \"the information at hand would not permit us to associate the fire with a manufacturing or assembly error\".  No reason for the fire was given.  Vehicle was inspected by insurance rep, investigator hired by the manufacturer.  Police and fire dept were on scene at the time but did not create a report, just gave me an incident #.  No warnings, messages or anything warned of the fire.  I was able to drive it around to the front of the building to get it away from the building and other cars while their was smoke coming out of it.  No warnings lights came on at all that I could see on the dash.  I want to report this incase any other Wrangler 4XE's end up having the same issue.",

I have videos of this. I had to get out and motion for traffic to go around us, several time we were almost hit. The car was towed to Grogan they got it in for service 3/28. It was discovered by the service manager on 3/23 when I purchased my new car that New car had an open recall on it launched 3/14/23, and the dealership entered 3/23/23 as the repair date to bypass the system because you can't sell a brand new car with an open recall. The car is dangerous, it has been sitting in service since 3/28 until present date totally disabled without ability to be fixed by Grogan experts. The car was unlawfully sold, it was not disclosed there was a open recall or I would have opted to buy a different car. The car is a lemon they will not take the car back although it was sold unlawfully New Cars are forbidden to be sold with open recalls, and open recalls are to be disclosed prior to selling consumers cars.

        "summary": "I was driving 65 on the freeway when the steering suddenly goes out &stiffens so hard I could not turn the car. It was very heavy. Fortunately all the cars were going in the same direction &I managed to merge over but was at that point going about 40 on the freeway, which is dangerous in itself There was a major warning light that went on, but of course, bc I was struggling w/the car, I couldn\u2019t read what it said, & then after I pulled over, I noticed another smaller warning light of the stop/start system, but from what I understand there could be any number of issues under that warning light  the dealer has had my car for over a week they can\u2019t find anything specific on the car. I have been looking at the Wrangler forums and heard similar complaints and similar incidences for over 6 yrs of dealers \u201cfixing\u201d this and that when in reality, it could be the 2 batteries in the car which are considered by many Jeep owners substandard coming from the factory, and it has been suggested I have them replace with Mopar batteries, (not the same factory batteries ) but apparently the factory will not reimburse the dealers for the batteries so they avoid placing batteries  at 700.- a pop when that could be the issue 75% of the time (that comes from experienced jeep owners on this forum) if I had been in cross traffic, or if I had to avoid an oncoming collision or a side collision I would not have been able to maneuver the car and it could\u2019ve been a disaster I doubt their ability to pinpoint the exact cause of this as they said they\u2019ve never seen this kind of an incident before  They were able to replicate the loss of steering, but they don\u2019t know how they did it if They could replace this and that, but there\u2019s no telling unless the incident happens again if it was really fixed, and I find this is too dangerous a chance to take as I could\u2019ve been killed.  No inspections of the component has been checked by anybody cause they don\u2019t know what component is malfunctioning",

        "summary": "I was driving approximately 30-35 mph when my vehicle engine no longer would accelerate. On the dashboard, the \"D\" to signify I was in drive was flashing in red, as opposed to being lit in white as usual. There was another warning light flashing in red, which was a lightning bolt with the characters ) ( around it. My car was dinging an alert sound. I was able to turn my flashers on and coast over to the side of the road. There was a significant safety concern considering I was in a city with cars driving around me, and had they not slowed, may have struck my vehicle because it decelerated so quickly. I attempted to push on the gas to accelerate, and nothing happened. After pulling over, I turned the vehicle off and back on again, and the problem was no longer there. Following this, my engine over-revs when I accelerate (3,500 + rpm to increase my speed by 10-15 mph with normal to light touch on the gas). I have noticed a jerkiness to acceleration and shifting of gears since this occurred also. Another issue is I will turn my car on and the engine will rev up to 2,000 + rpms without me touching the gas to accelerate. It will idle around 2,000 rpms until I drive or turn it off. I purchased this Jeep brand new. I see on Consumer Report there will be recalls in January 2023 on Jeep Wranglers 4xe manufactured a few months prior to the one I purchased with the same issue that I am having. I brought it in to the Jeep dealership where I purchased it. They ran diagnostics but said they were unable to find any issues. They took it for a test drive and were also unable to decipher anything wrong with it.  This is a safety concern because if I am driving on the interstate or highway at appropriate speeds and my engine stops working like this again, I may be struck or cause an accident that could cause myself or others harm. The fact that 2021-2023 Jeep wrangler 4xe's manufactured prior to mine are going to be recalled in January with this same issue is concerning.",
