I looked it up and there are countless complaints on this and Chrysler/Jeep do nothing about this huge safety risk !    Answers to your questions   1. Braking system as a whole and yes it can't move  2. If you do not have brakes in a vehicle you cannot stop so unsafe for the driver and everyone on the road bc of collision.   3. Yes my mechanic has re done this job multiple times and agrees there is a defect going on, not normal.   4. I did not know I needed my insurance or the police involved, the dealership is a joke.   5.

Brakes temping 550 - unreadable (temp gun wouldn't register)  Mechanic recommends unsafe to drive because brakes could seize and cause sudden stop and/or accident  Dealer says too bad, normal wear and tear.

DTC C1252-92 VACUUM PUMP CONTROL CIRCUIT And Or P258B ELECTRONIC VACUUM PUMP PERFORMANCE Discussion: If ABS has C1252-92 Active or Stored do not replace the brake system module (ABS). PCM may also have set P258B-00. The faults are pointing to vacuum pump system having an issue maintaining vacuum levels. Please check the vacuum pump operation, fusing, wiring, and connector for proper functionality. Poor connections, spread pins, damaged connectors are possible causes. Perform the diagnostic for the DTC P258B regardless if it is set or not, since it is more compressive of a test than C1252-92. In addition when checking Vacuum lines, please ensure to check Vacuum hoses and check valves between the engine intake, booster and vacuum pump. Because the check valves only allow flow of air on one direction, each vacuum circuit must be checked separately to make sure there are no leaks, kinks or damages. Please refer to the correct vacuum diagram. For KL vehicles: inspect ALL under hood grounds for connection and contact issues. My Jeep is at the Ford Dealership I work at at this time.  Didn't want to drive any farther than I had to at this time.",

All this on a new vehicle is insane and a safety hazard for a vehicle this young AND with this low of mileage.  I took ownership of this jeep in March of 2020 with 33k miles. Then in January 2021 with about 40k miles on the car being 3 1/2 years old the back calipers seized causing smoke and burning smell and was a fire hazard and unsafe to drive. Fast forward another year and a few months later on May 13th I was driving the vehicle and the BACK calipers siezed while in operation and now both rear sides had to be replaced, rotators, calipers, brakes and hoses. A year and 1/2 later only 15,000 more miles.   So now all 4 calipers siezed and were replaced, motors, brakes, hoses. This most recent time it was to the cost of $1427.15. I googled this issue and it is a common issue and a known issue in jeeps especially in 2017s. A complaint from 2017 shows a gentleman was reimbursed for this exact issue by FCA after his complaint and I am looking for the same.  I have also had the engine cylinders misfire and go up in this jeep as well that occurred 2 months ago!",

Then, two days ago my \"Malfunction Warning Light\" (check engine light) came in my dashboard and remained illuminated after an oil change and gas fill. I took my Jeep to the local Crystler/Jeep/Dodge/Ram dealership where they told me the code for the problem was a \"Evap System Small Leak,\" but they could not take my car in for another week to look into the issue further. This concerned me, so I then took my Jeep to a Midas where they ran many tests to find that I had a \"small fracture where the FPS inserts to the tank.\" Midas told me that although it is just the leak detection and purge valve that need a minor repair, this part cannot be purchased separately and I would need to pay to replace the whole gas tank for $2700. The technician told me he had seen this a few times before with Jeep Wranglers around the same year as mine before the 2018 models came out with a new tank, and that I couldn't have done anything to cause it because it is just a substandard part that was put in Jeeps of my model/year.   I was told that if this issue is not corrected soon, it is unsafe to drive. A larger crack could grow and cause fuel to leak, which then becomes a fire safety hazard. The current fuel emissions/vapors escaping are harmful to breathe in, and to the environment. I was told my Jeep wouldn't pass smog inspection in it's current state.   I have found a Crystler recall for faulty 2017 Jeep Wrangler fuel tanks, Recall no. 16V849000 (Crystler Recall no. S90) that applies exactly to my situation. However, although it is the exact problem I am experiencing, the dealership told me there are no open recalls for my specific 2017 Jeep Wrangler.    I now have an open appointment to have the dealership take a closer look, but I don't believe I should need to pay for this large repair since it was a clear recall and common issue with 2017 Jeep Wranglers just like mine.",

The Jeep began overheating. I disconnected the battery terminals and the Jeep still would not shut off. Finally I was able to find a large fuse to remove which shut off the Jeep.",

I got the battery checked two weeks ago and all was fine. Several times that my car does not turn on the electrial light shows up on my dash. I have found many people have had this same issue- however MOPAR has not recalled it. Recall Number 18V524000, Report Data Aug 9, 2018- Electrical System- Wiring, front underhood. __The powertrain control module may be equipped with a voltage regulator chip in the circuit board that may fail, causing a stall or a no start condition. I have seen the electrical light on my dashboard, however this is always random. The dealership says to replace the battery, which when they sent over the results they didnt even show what it mesaured.

WE WERE APPROACHING A SMALL CITY WITH STREET LIGHTS WHICH MADE TRAVELING SAFER.  I PULLED OFF AN EXIT TO ASSESS THE HEADLIGHT ISSUE.  BOTH HEADLIGHTS WERE COVERED IN SNOW.  SINCE THE JEEPS LIGHTS ARE RECESSES A BIT, THE SNOW FILLED THE POCKETS COMPLETELY. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME DRIVING (SINCE 1984) THAT I HAD TO CLEAR SNOW FROM THE HEADLIGHTS WHILE DRIVING.  I LIVE IN NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND SO SNOW IN THE WINTER IS A COMMON EVENT.  WHAT I DEDUCED WAS THAT THE LED LIGHTS WERE NOT GENERATING ANY HEAT.  THIS WAS THE LIKELY REASON FOR THE SNOW BUILD UP.   THIS FLAW IS EXCEPTIONALLY DANGEROUS.  WHEN I NEEDED THE LIGHTS TO WORK THEIR BEST, THEY FAILED.  COLD WEATHER AND DARKNESS ARE PREVALENT THIS TIME OF YEAR.

I AM NOW A HORRIFIED WOMAN THAT KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT WHY MY NEW JEEP WRANGLER CATCHES ON FIRE OUT OF NO WHERE WHILE IN MOTION! ONCE WE SAW FIRE FLAMES, SMOKE AND RED OIL ON FIRE COMING OUT FROM ENGINE AREA AND BELOW THE VEHICLE DRIVERS SIDE, WE QUICKLY STOPPED ON RESIDENTIAL STREET. ME, MY 70 YEAR OLD MOTHER WHO IS SICK AND MY 24 YEAR OLD AUTISTIC DAUGHTER HAD TO JUMP OUT OF THIS FIRE TRAP VEHICLE SCREAMING AND CRYING!!!   THIS WAS AN UNEXPLAINED AND SPONTANEOUS FIRE!!! WHY? NO REASON BEHIND IT AND NOTHING THAT I DID TO CAUSE IT. THE FIRE WAS LUCKILY AND QUICKLY EXTINGUISHED BY GOOD SAMARITANS AND CITY WORKERS NEAR BY. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED AND SHOWED UP ALONG WITH POLICE OFFICER. FIRE DEPARTMENT TOLD ME TO WRITE A COMPLAINT ON THESE VEHICLES BECAUSE THEY HAVE HAD TO RESPOND TO MANY JEEP WRANGLER FIRES IN THE LAST 10 YEARS. I WAS SHOCKED AND HORRIFIED, HOW CAN THIS BE???  HOW BAD THIS COULD HAVE TURN OUT TO BE IF CITY WORKERS WHERE NOT NEAR BY WITH A FIRE EXTINGUISHER?.   JEEP NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED. PLEASE PROTECT THE CONSUMERS AND JEEP WRANGLER OWNERS WHO ARE UNAWARE OF THESE FIRE TRAPS. THIS IS SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS FIRE ISSUES ON JEEP WRANGLERS. I PRAY YOU START AN INSTIGATION AND RECALL SO THAT NOBODY ELSE HAS TO GO THROUGH THIS HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE! *BF  UPDATED 8/3/18*JB",
