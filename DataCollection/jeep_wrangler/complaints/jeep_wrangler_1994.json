CHRYSLER'S ANSWERS WHEN I COMPLAINED WERE - I USED EXCESSIVE FORCE ALL THE TIME.  THE DRIVERS SEAT BROKE - FIRST TIME I RECLINDED IT.  AFTER TEARING IT APART - IT WAS OBVIOUSLY MADE VERY CHEAPLY - ONE THIN METAL PART GOING UP THE BACK OF THE SEAT.

SAME WITH THE PLASTIC PARTS FOR THE WINDOW ROLLER (EASILY BREAKABLE) AND WHO DESIGNED THE STUPID PART (BAR AND PIN) FOR THE DOOR LOCKS.  OH YEAH, AND MY ENGINED DIED ONCE - $200 IN NEW WIRING AND TOE BILLS.  THEY TOLD ME I MUST HAVE BEEN OFFROAD RUFFING IT - EXCESSIVE FORCE AGAIN.  I NEVER TOOK THE JEEP OFFROAD EVER - BUT OF COURSE THEY WOULD NOT BELIEVE ME.  ALSO, I HAVE REPLACED THE FRONT WINDSHIELD 3 TIMES NOW.
