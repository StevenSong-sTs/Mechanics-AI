But it got so bad to the point that I would be going 15-20 mph and out of nowhere my vehicle would start violently shaking and my steering wheel would jerk side to side. The ONLY way to get it to stop would be to completely let off the pedals and let it come to a complete stop by itself. Hitting the brakes could cause it to flip. Having to come to a stop, regardless of the location could cause a serious accident or pile up. Trying to control the steering wheel when this is occurring could cause an accident as well. This is not something that happens here and there. This incident is so frequent that there are websites that try to warn and help others bc it happens so after. Its cost me $4000 trying to fix it. Please look into this and help us resolve this issue before it costs someone their dad or mom or brother or sister, or someone their child or grandchild. Thank you for your time.

I heard a loud bang emit from under vehicle. At which point all forward motion stopped & the vehicle would not move at all when the accelerator was pressed.  The engine was running and all electrical components continued to function. It stopped in the road and was not able to make it to the shoulder without being pushed. Fortunately traffic was light and the vehicles behind me were able to stop before a collision. Had this happened on the highway or at an intersection  the outcome could have been much worse. There were no warning lights prior to or after the failure.   I had the vehicle towed to the dealer who requested 3 hours of shop time to disassemble the powertrain. At which point i was contacted and told i needed a new transfer case. When i went to look at the transfer case i saw that the transfer case adapter and external housing was rusted and the gears were worn away. (photos) . Upon taking the part to mechanics and another dealer I was informed such wear was not a result  normal usage, wear and tear.  I opened a case with FCA (82582111) to enquire as to how the failure occurred. The FCA nor the dealer provided any explanation as to how the failure occurred. For background , the vehicle was custom ordered from the factory, and purchased new in 2014. It a had 64990 miles at the time of the failure. I'm the original owner & only driver of the vehicle. The vehicle has never been off-roaded or driven through high water. The vehicle has not been modified other than a Mopar 2\" lift kit installed by the dealer. All scheduled factory service , maintenance and inspections were performed  by the dealer.  The extent of the rusting and the wearing of the components would indicate that the issue had been occurring for some time. Yet it was not detectable without the vehicle being lifted and the transfer case removed.",

Found the following in my search: \"  ATTENTION - 2014 Wranglers have bad oil leak problems! ________________________________________ For 2014, Chrysler made a change to a part called the \"oil filter adapter\" which sits on top of the engine, under the intake manifold. There are now a parade of people with various Chrysler vehicles that use the 3.6L reporting that the new part cracks, causing a major oil leak, potentially a fire, and can cause your engine to be drained of all oil.  If you have had an oil leak, and the dealership told you the issue was the oil filter adapter, the oil cooler or the oil cooler cover, post up here. We are going to try to get pressure on Chrysler to at least redesign the part.  Part number is 68105583AA and it applies only to 2014 3.6L Chrysler V6 engines, at least so far. Similar issues have been reported with the new 3.2L V6 used in the Cherokee, but it apparently has a different part number.  This is a MAJOR issue if you own a 2014 Wrangler. There is no way to know if/when the part will crack, and if it does, it is not a trail repair. The adapter is buried under the intake manifold, and ever getting to it with some putty would be nearly impossible. You had better have extra oil with you at all times if you are trail riding a 2014 Wrangler.  Post here if you have the issue, and go to safercar.gov and file a complaint. If Chrysler doesn't fix this issue, you will never feel safe wheeling your 2014 Jeep in the backcountry. They need to fix this, NOW.  ALL 3.6L vehicles are affected\"",

Due to the location of the oil cooler assembly, it can't be easily replaced without spending over a thousand dollars and then the dealers don't stand behind or warranty the new part/their install because they know the replacement is just plastic and going to crack again.  Oil leaks all over other engine components (transmission, transfer case, etc.), which could cause the vehicle to catch on fire; an accident due to the leaked on components being deteriorated and not working properly from being oil soaked; or cause the engine oil to overheat since the cooling assembly isn't working correctly.  Repair requires complete disassembly of the upper engine and the OEM replacement is just another faulty plastic parts.  Repairs are extremely costly IF you can even find parts.

The concern is that a manufacturing or design defect is the cause and because of the hazard created by the leak, is a serious issue and should be addressed by Jeep.  Jeep has acknowledged that this issue should not occur and has offered some minimal assistance on repair costs, however my concern is with having to replace an entire fuel tank at 65,000 miles on a Jeep product and the safety concerns with the potential for this to occur without a root cause (other than product failure or defect).  This should not be considered a 'wear and tear' part and have a much longer life than 65,000 miles.

Upon speaking with over 15 dealerships in Southern California, they noted that there were over 40,000 of this replacement part on back-order as of March 2020.   I had to wait two months to get the part delivered, which meant I went two months without a vehicle, and then had to pay over $800+ on a part + labor on an item that should absolutely be recalled. There are thousands of posts on Wrangler Forum and other Jeep pages that share the exact same issue. Jeep has ignored this issue since 2014, and it's only occurring in more vehicles now. This part breaking can cause engine seizure or failure and should not be a cost to the customer as there is CLEARLY a nation-wide problem that Chrysler is ignoring.",

THERE ARE MANY DOCUMENTED CASES ON ONLINE FORUMS WITH RADIATORS GOING OUT OR LEAKING WITH ONLY A FEW THOUSAND MILES AND BEING COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. HOWEVER, SOME DEALERS WOULD ARGUE THAT THE COOLANT SMELL IS NORMAL, IN ORDER TO PUSH THE REPAIR FURTHER OUT. MY VEHICLE ONLY HAS 46K MILES AND HAS A LEAK ON THE DRIVER SIDE PORTION OF THE RADIATOR WHERE THE ALUMINUM PART OF THE RADIATOR MEETS WITH THE PLASTIC PART OF THE RADIATOR. THE LEAK IS VERY SLOW AND MOST PEOPLE MIGHT NOT REALIZE IT (THIS IS WHAT MAKES IT EVEN MORE DANGEROUS!!) OTHER THAN FOR THE COOLANT SMELL NEAR THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE. I BELIEVE A DEFECTIVE RADIATOR LIKE THIS COULD CAUSE SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN AS ITS HIGHLY PROBABLE TO BLOW AT ANYTIME GIVEN HOW MUCH PRESSURE IS IN THE COOLING SYSTEM. THIS WOULD BE DANGEROUS AND POTENTIALLY DEADLY IF IT WERE TO GO OUT ON THE FREEWAY, OR OUT IN A REMOTE AREA, OR EVEN FOR SOMEONE WORKING IN THE ENGINE BAY OR UNDER THE CAR. JEEP KNOWS THIS IS A PROBLEM, BUT IF YOU'RE OUT OF WARRANTY THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT, EVEN IF IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME IT'S HAPPENED.",

MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTING ON ITS OWN WAS COMING UP A STREET WHERE I DOWNSHIFTED TO 2ND GEAR....THE JEEP THEN SHIFTED INTO 1ST ON ITS OWN AND THEN UPSHIFTED TO 3RD, THEN DOWN TO 2ND & THEN TO 1ST, ALL ON ITS OWN. I THEN CAME TO A STOP SIGN & PUT IT BACK INTO DRIVE FOR AUTOMATIC HOPING THAT IT WOULD STOP. FOR ABOUT 2-3 WEEKS AFTER THAT, IT SEEMED THAT THE TRANSMISSION SLIPPED EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE & THEN NOTHING. IT DROVE FINE. I NEVER TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP FROM THAT ONE OR TWO INSTANCES. ON 8/5/19 I TOOK MY JEEP IN FOR A REGULAR OIL CHANGE. KONA KWIK LUBE LOOKED AT EVERYTHING & SAID THAT EVERYTHING ON THE JKU LOOKED GREAT. I THEN HAD TO LEAVE TOWN FOR A WEEK & UPON RETURN FROM THE MAINLAND, I HAD NUMEROUS DROPS (OF WHAT I THOUGHT WAS OIL) ON THE FLOOR OF MY CARPORT. I TOOK MY JEEP TO REPAIR SHOP FOR DIAGNOSTIC & WAS TOLD THAT THEY SAW SIGNS OF OIL LEAK FROM THE OIL FILTER HOUSING, BUT WERE UNABLE TO PINPOINT LOCATION OF LEAK. AS I KNEW THE MANAGER OF KKL, I TOOK IT BACK THERE. THEY CLEANED UP THE AREA & STATED THAT IT WAS NOT OIL LEAK. UPON RETURNING HOME, I HAD NO LEAKS COMING FROM THE JEEP FOR 2 WEEKS.THEN THE LEAKS STARTED. I WENT BACK TO KKL ON 10/9/19 WHERE THEY PUT DYE IN THE ENGINE TO FIND THE LEAK. ON 10/14/19 THEY SAW NO DYE IN THE ENGINE, THEREBY NOTING THAT IT WAS TRANSMISSION. I WENT TO TRANSMISSION TECHNOLOGY RIGHT AFTER, & I WAS ADVISED THAT I HAD A GERMAN TRANSMISSION & THE TRANSMISSION PUMP, SEALS, ETC.

I FOUND OUT THAT CHRYSLER/JEEP HAS BEEN HAVING ISSUES WITH THEIR OIL FILTER/COOLER HOUSING SINCE 2013/2014.  I HAVE ALSO FOUND OUT THAT THEY HAVE MADE 3+ ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR THIS PART BUT HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL TO HAVE ALL OF THESE REPLACED.    FROM THE MECHANICS I'VE DISCUSSED THIS WITH THE ISSUE IS QUITE DANGEROUS.  THE OIL LEAKS FROM THIS HOUSING DOWN INTO THE \"V\" OF THE ENGINE BETWEEN THE VALVES AND SITS THERE WITH THE POTENTIAL OF CATCHING FIRE AND BURNING THE VEHICLE AND ITS OCCUPANTS.    THE MFG KNOWS THIS IS AN ISSUE FOR THE LAST 3-4 YEARS BUT IS EXPECTING THE OWNERS TO PAY FOR THE DEFECT FROM MANUFACTURING.  THE MFG SHOULD BE REPLACING THESE PARTS AS PART OF A LARGER RECALL.  I AM CURRENTLY MILES FROM HOME (900 MILES) AND NOW WILL HAVE TO ADD OIL EVERY SO OFTEN TO ENSURE THE ENGINE DOESN'T SEAZE UP ON THE WAY HOME THEN BE OUT PERSONAL TIME TRYING TO GET IT FIXED.",

THE ACCELERATOR \"STUCK\" A SECOND TIME, AND SO I PRESSED THE BRAKE PEDAL AGAIN AND THE VEHICLE RESPONDED AGAIN BY SLOWING BUT THIS TIME, WHEN I WENT TO ACCELERATE AGAIN TO KEEP PACE WITH TRAFFIC, THE GAS PEDAL WAS COMPLETELY NON-RESPONSIVE (I.E., THE PEDAL HAD SEEMED TO FALL TO THE FLOOR AND PRESSING IT DID NOT RESULT IN ANY FURTHER ACCELERATION). I PULLED ONTO THE LEFT SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY AND CALLED ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE TO HAVE IT TOWED TO THE JEEP DEALERSHIP. DEALERSHIP VERBALLY TOLD ME COMPUTER FAULT CODE READ AS \"ACCELERATOR PEDAL IN CORRELATION\" AND SAID THE GAS PEDAL MODULE WAS READING INCORRECTLY. SERVICE ADVISOR ADMITTED TO HAVING SEEN THIS PROBLEM BEFORE. WHEN PICKING UP VEHICLE, SERVICE ADVISOR TOLD ME THAT PROBLEM WAS DUE TO EXCESSIVE DIRT ON/BEHIND THE GAS PEDAL. THERE IS NO WAY IT WAS CAUSED BY THIS, AS JEEP HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN OFF-ROAD, NO ONE DRIVES IT WITH MUDDY SHOES, ETC. ACCELERATOR PEDAL ASSEMBLY WAS REPLACED AND PCM WAS UPDATED TO THE MOST CURRENT SOFTWARE LEVEL. PREVIOUSLY ON THIS VEHICLE, THE SENTRY KEY WAS REPLACED AS WAS THE ENTIRE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER, AS WAS THE FRONT STABILIZER/SWAY BAR.  NOT SURE IF THE STUCK ACCELERATOR IS DUE TO A COMPUTER/SOFTWARE GLITCH OR A MECHANICAL FAILURE. A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH REVEALED THAT ISSUES WITH \"STUCK\" ACCELERATORS ON THIS MAKE/MODEL/YEAR VEHICLE ARE NOT UNCOMMON. INVOICE ATTACHED. PLEASE INVESTIGATE.",

IN ORDER FOR US TO CORRECT THE ISSUE WE HAVE TO TAKE THE VEHICLE INTO THE JEEP FACILITY PAY $100.00 FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC CHECK TO BE COMPLETED AND AN ADDITIONAL $252.00 FOR THE CIRCUIT TO BE CORRECTED AND REPLACED. THE VEHICLE CURRENTLY HAS 47,000 ON IT AND AFTER WE SPOKE WITH JEEP CORPORATE THEY SPECIFIED THAT THE ONLY WAY THEY WOULD EVEN LOOK INTO IT IS FOR US TO HAS THE SERVICE DONE AND PROVIDE THEM WITH A TICKET NUMBER. THIS IS UNDERSTANDABLE BUT THE LOCAL JEEP COMPANY LOCATED IN JACKSONVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA ONLY HAS A NEXT AVAILABLE APPOINTMENT 5 DAYS FROM NOW ON JANUARY 11, 2016. THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE WITH US DRIVING THE VEHICLE AS THIS VEHICLE IS ALSO THE VEHICLE THAT TRANSPORTS A CHILD WITH A BRAIN INJURY FROM A VEHICLE ACCIDENT. SO FROM OUR UNDERSTANDING WE CAN EITHER DRIVE THE VEHICLE WHICH COULD POSSIBLY LOCK UP BECAUSE THE ENGINE IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH OIL PRESSURE TO IT, OR , WE CAN WAIT 5 DAYS WITH NOT DRIVING OUR VEHICLE AND HAVE THE MALFUNCTION CORRECTED. WE WERE INFORMED THAT THEY WOULD NOT CORRECT THE ISSUE FOR FREE BECAUSE TECHNICALLY IT HAS NOT BEEN PLACED ON A RECALL LIST AS OF YET. THIS IS PUTTING FAMILIES IN DANGER AND UNCALLED FOR.

I TOOK THE JEEP INTO THE DEALERSHIP ON MARCH 6TH AND THEY NOTICED THE SPILLING OF OIL.  I DROPPED OF MY JEEP WITH THEM AND THEY SAID THEY FIXED IT.  THEY SAID THAT MY OIL COOLER WAS LEAKING.  AND THEY REPLACED THE OIL COOLER.  COME TO FIND OUT THIS IS A MAJOR FIRE HAZARD.  A BRAND NEW CAR AND THE OIL COOLER FAILS.  THEY WERE REALLY VAGUE AS TO WHY THIS HAPPENED AND BRUSHED ME OFF TELLING ME \"ITS FIXED, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT\".  I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE NOW DRIVING MY JEEP AND I AM CONCERNED IF THIS IS A LEMON CAR.  I SPOKE TO SEVERAL MANAGERS OVER AT RIVER OAKS CHRYSLER JEEP AND THEY SEEMED TO BRUSH ME OFF AND WOULD TELL ME \"YOU ARE GETTING MAD OVER A CAR; ONE OF OUR SALES JUST FOUND OUT HE HAS CANCER\".
