Also, as the display remains on even when the vehicle is turned off the battery may run dead leaving the driver stranded.

        "summary": "VIN [XXX]  Hi everyone, I\u2019m new to the group and hoping for some guidance and support.  I tried to message Jeep Cares but the message button does not appear on their profile name.  I bought my 2018 Jeep wrangler JKU Rubicon December 2021 with 29k miles on it and by May 2022 my clutch blew out with only 32k miles on it!  They said it was the worst they\u2019ve seen (doubt it) and would not cover it.  In fact, they wanted $4k to replace it with a mopar one.  I told them where to go and bought a centerforce dual friction and had it installed at a local shop for $3,700.  I chose centerforce to avoid having issues again with the mopar one.  Everything was fine till the rear main seal went out and had to be replaced under warranty.  When I got it back there was a ticking noise at the top of the clutch pedal and they didn\u2019t even put the heat shield back in so the cab was hot as hell.  I ended up paying a local shop to put the heat shield back in since the dealer said they were behind and would take months.  Now here I am a year later.  The dealer just installed a new engine under warranty after only 47k miles on the original.  They just called to tell me the work is done but btw\u2026the clutch is blown.  I told them there\u2019s no way in hell that\u2019s possible since I just put on in on May 2022.  I reminded them I reported the noise back when I got it back from the rear main seal being done.  I was then told she was going to \u201ctalk to her manager \u201c.  The next call was to tell me \u201csorry, we can\u2019t do anything and it\u2019s dangerous to drive it the way it is.  I had no other choice but to authorize another clutch.  I can\u2019t afford to spend another $3,700.  I\u2019ve driven a clutch since I was 12 on my grandpas farm.  This is absurd.  Every vehicle I\u2019ve had has been clutch and never had a problem till I bought this one.  Where do I start?  Not only should they put a new one in now but they should also reimburse me for the last one!  Why is this happening and how do I prevent it again?

        "summary": "Customer Satisfaction Notification [XXX] Steering Damper  The 2018 Jeep Wrangler is experiencing what many are calling \"The Death Wobble\" due to the fact that when driving at speeds exceeding 50 MPH or so, the vehicles steering system begins to shake uncontrollably. We purchased the vehicle for my son preowned on May 4, 2023 and at that time it seemed to be working fine. However, a couple of months later when I was teaching my son how to drive the shake started and its gotten progressively worst ever since. At first we thought it needed an alignment but that didn't help much. We then took it in for another alignment at Firestone where they reported the wobble and advised me that many Jeeps of that year were being recalled for the Steering Damper issue. I called the FCA Service number (1-800-853-1403) and opened case number [XXX]. I was told that I must take the vehicle to a Jeep Service Center which I did immediately that same day. The Jeep Dealership confirmed the issue and its severity, advising me to call the recall center again. Today when I called FCA again they refused to let me speak to a manager and told me the case had been closed. They refused to help me with this issue based on a technicality. It seems our Jeep is a JK Unlimited and they recalled the JL of that same year (2018-2019). The death wobble looks and feels terrifying because you can lose control of your vehicle. My son is a new driver so this is even more worrisome to me. I've read that many accidents have already occurred due to this issue. However, no one at the FCA is helping me with this widely known issue and I do not know what to do. We simply can not afford the $4,200 bill to fix it and by driving it I am putting the driver and other innocent bystanders in danger as well. Please advise on what I can do next. Thank you for your time and consideration. INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

The vehicle was towed to a jeep dealer ship; the car had to be dragged onto the flat bed. The tow truck driver needed to use a soup product to slide the car on the street and on to the bed. I will not hear back from the dealer ship till next week on exactly what happened. I was coming out of the mall parking lot to get onto the Garden State Parkway. If I had been on the Parkway doing 65 mph, I firmly believe I would have been severely injured. I have been told by the dealer ship they have seen this throughout the brands. The dealer ship sells and services Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep. This is not the dealer I purchase the wrangler from. I purchased this vehicle as a certified used. I find this incident very disturbing and I am seriously concerned about someone getting severely hurt or worse a fatality. I would like to further discuss this with someone, this needs to be addressed.",

This includes service shifter, service airbags, service braking system, ABS warning, cruise control disabled and many others. When it does this, which is daily, the power steering goes out completely at highway speeds and sometimes curves. This has caused me to nearly hit other drivers head on with my family in the vehicle with me. It has left me stranded many times by not recognizing the key fobs and locking the transmission in park at stop lights. I just bought the vehicle, with 64000 miles on it, in October as my primary transportation and I am afraid to drive it. This has caused me severe hardship and endangered mine and my family's life on several occasions. This problem is extremely common with my model year, as seen on several online forums and Jeep has refused to acknowledge the problem or recall the vehicles. It was purchased from a Jeep dealer, Tim Short of Middlesboro Ky. I can understand wear and tear on vehicles, but this has been an issue with 2018 Jeep Rubicons for years.  If this problem goes uncorrected, many people WILL die as a result of this issue. Autos are the only thing I know of that, if defective, cannot be returned for a full refund. Something should be done, since I have an 800 dollar monthly payment and nothing to show for it. Thank you for any help you may provide.",

        "summary": "I own a 2018 Jeep JL Rubicon Wrangler. My complaint is the steering issue that NHTSA already is aware of and has a TSB issued on this particular malfunction. After spending a substantial amount of money for such vehicle, and there being a major issue with the aluminum steering box, I feel this should be an actual recall Jeep should make right for all of their loyal customers.  Every forum I read about this steering issue, it is the same complaints, that Jeep should be responsible for replacing the Aluminum box with the steel steering box they have already upgraded to after 2020, because they knew it was an issue. My steering is very sloppy, I have already had a mechanic try to tighten the steering box and said it cannot be tightened again, and next time it needs to be replaced.  I should not have to spend almost $1200 for an issue that is not my fault nor is it normal wear and tear. I feel unsafe in my vehicle no matter what speed I am going.  It is all over the road and I am surprised a police officer has not pulled me over thinking I am driving drunk because the steering makes the vehicle sway from one side of the lane to the other and has to be corrected all the time. My fear is, one day I will not be able to control the steering because something will let loose and cause me to vere off the road and hit an obstruction, or worse, hit somebody else. This is not covered under warranty once the vehicle hits a certain number of miles, which I am over and many other people are too. Please take this matter serious and look further into it to see how bad this issue really is.  It is not safe for all these Jeep Wranglers to be on the road with faulty steering boxes, which is a major part of the drive system in a vehicle. I don't have any children, but I can imagine the many of people who do drive these vehicles and has children in the cars with them on a daily basis, and has no clue there is a major issue going on with their steering.

The second recall is for the same issue and has had a status of \"remedy not available\" for too long. The clutch assembly can overheat but the clutch also regularly slips creating acceleration issues. There have been countless occurrences of pulling into traffic and the clutch slipping and almost being hit by other vehicles. In addition, the potential for the transmission bell house to fracture and the vehicle to catch on fire is a major concern.    There are many posts in online Jeep JL forums. There is a \"jeep clutch recall\" facebook group with man examples of these issues and the lack of concern from the manufacturer to offer a solution.  Stellantis seems to know there is an issue but has been in no rush to rectify the situation. There has been very little communication about this issue and local Jeep dealerships never have any more information that consumers do.   We need to have new clutch assemblies installed or be given a simple and quick way to be reimbursed for having an aftermarket clutch assembly installed.",

She only had a two minute warning which was not enough time to pull over to a safe place without risking injury from being hit from another vehicle. The Jeep ended up and powered down within the two minutes of receiving the warning which caused loss of engine power, no power steering and no power brakes. This seems to be a pretty dangerous combination. It literally left her in the roadway. We had the batteries checked and they are ok. The vehicle did start back but the warning light came on again so it is parked until we can get it towed to the dealership. Researching it online it seems to be a common issue with the 2018 JLU.

If you have had previous repairs performed and/or already received reimbursement, you may still need to have the recall performed.\"  I submitted my repair and proof of payment documents and they immediately closed my case because a remedy is not available.  This makes no sense and contradicts the statement.  Obviously I need to replace the clutch and flywheel.  Now the replacement is putting off the same burning odor and I have to wait for a remedy knowing there is potential for a fire.  I believe this has been an ongoing issue and should have been remedied long ago.  Especially considering my vehicle is a 2018.  There have been no warning indicators or lights.   I drive my young grandsons around in this vehicle.  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",

The stereo volume, wipers, and cabin fan speed also can fluctuate wildly; worst case. This issue first appeared after going through a puddle, and seems to be exacerbated by high EMF areas; this is only corollary. This vehicle has never been used roughly or off road. The obvious dangers are, spontaneous maniacal warnings are a significant distraction to driving; if stop/start is not disabled vehicle will not start after stop at intersection, causing disruption to traffic; if power steering randomly stops working, which occurs while stopped or driving, the vehicle is nearly impossible to drive, and can only practically be driven by a strongman athlete. The coup de gr\u00e2ce where everything goes berserk, is usually when parked and attempting to reset the condition. The problem has not been reproduced by a dealer or service center; I have spent days inspecting grounds, harnesses, and inspecting, cleaning and replacing connectors. There's also a long list of mostly random codes for nearly everything, including the persistent lost communication with TCM. Up to October 2022 and 66,000 miles the only warnings or codes were for, wheel sensor (rep under warrantee), and \"Small Leak In Vapor Recovery System\" (leaky gas cap). A month+ after the warrantee expired, at about 66,000 mi, the vehicle began to generate random warnings and codes, and became unbearable (and dangerous) to drive. My observations and inspections and limited testing (haven't probed system circuits directly) lead to an assertion that the problem is system wide; many wildly various, mostly non repeatable, codes are recorded, systems that shut down are wildly various and not always repeatable; like there's nothing specifically or consistently wrong-but everything is failing. 5V reg in TCM?",

I have had the vehicle back to Lafontaine Jeep in Lansing MI which they said the replacement of the steering stabilizer would be covered under the 2 year part warranty however Lafontaine can't get the part in and has no estimate when the part will be available.  I spoke with Myah at FCA Customer Car and she said there are no parts available as well, no eta for when the parts will be available, and that there is no help available.

The jeep company refused to pay for the repair even though there was a recall on the clutch.  After I posted on social media about the issue, Jeep reached out to me in a DM and resolved the issue.  The same issue happened on or about in November/December 2022.  Given my past history the the jeep I recognized the same symptoms of the clutch failing and stopped driving the jeep.  I contacted several local dealers to see if they would repair it and again told me that there is nothing wrong with the clutch, and it was not covered under any recall since it was fix for the first clutch failure.  I reached out to jeep through social media and was told that there was nothing they could do as there was no open recalls.  Having no faith in the jeep parts I had the jeep towed to my local repair shop.  It was confirmed that it was the same issue.  I told them to fix the issue, but not to use any OME parts.  I have had many manual tran cars and never had a clutch that went out, let alone with less than 50k miles on it.  This jeep has had two (on the third) and each had less than 50 k.  Given how the jeep can catch fire from this defect, it is sad that jeep does not take it seriously when life can be lost.",

So I thought it was weird but I though it might have been just the railroad on October 22, My sis and are on the freeway, about to merge to the left lane to a different freeway, I felt the jeep was hitting a pump.  Then immediately  the jeep starts wobbling and shaking that I wasn't able to hold on the steering wheel. I was soo scare that I'm going to hit the other cars and cause accidents. I took the foot off the gas paddle , just let it be while I'm still holding the wheel. Trying to move to the right lane , it was just impossible.  The jeep was like jumping around. The wheel was so stiff just cannot move. Finally after awhile the wobbling stopped. I slowly move the jeep to the right lane and drive to the nearest exit. Then I called the dealership right away and told them what happened. Will get back to you soon, that was the answer I got each time I called that day. Which I had called at least 4 times.  Next day my friend told me to take this dependable car dealer shop, it has lots of good review and highly recommended. Left the jeep there for couple of days> It was tested with high speed with high bumps. No problem was found. Since then I tried to avoid the freeway, I got nervous driving on the freeway with these bad experience  Nov13,22 meeting a friend because of the distance I have to get on the freeway. I was more conscious, I'm holding steering wheels with both hands. after 7 to 8 miles , sure enough the wobbling starts but since i have both hands holding it , I was as frightened as the precious time. After the wobbling stopped, I drove slowly to the destination. With all these scarcely experience. Every time I drive , I'm really nervous. Finally i took it to the dealership. It was diagnosis the steering damper. Unfortunately, it was back order till march or April this year.  So,",

There was also a message indicating the  ESS was not working due to the battery charging.  I took the Jeep to my mechanic (Not Jeep dealership mechanic) on January 14, 2022. The main battery voltage was checked and was above 12.7 volts. The auxiliary battery was checked and was approx 10.5 volts. I decided to replace the the auxiliary battery. Once replaced the ESS system started to work again and all electronic features returned to normal. Sometime in November 2022 the ESS stopped working. The ESS error message returned indicating the ESS was not working due to the battery charging. In late December 2022 the Jeep had a dead main (original)  battery. The main battery was jumped and the vehicle started and ran normally for about a week. The voltage was checked several times using the voltage meter in the settings menu. Each time the voltage showed reading above 14 volts. One week after the first dead battery the battery went dead again. It was jumped again and started. The vehicle remained on and in park for one hour and was then driven. During the test drive I stopped the Jeep momentarily in the roadway to check the ignition. The Jeep did not start and could not be jumped. As a result of the battery failure my vehicle was blocking the roadway and could not be shifted out of park and into neutral. This was a dangerous situation.  Later the voltage on both batteries was checked. The main batt voltage was 10.5 and the aux battery was 10.8 volts.    This is a 2018 Jeep JLU. The first aux battery failed and was replaced in January 2022. The second aux battery has failed and will be replaced in January 2023 along with the main (original) battery. Three battery failures in one year is not acceptable.",

        "summary": "In right lane of US19 south bound at about 58 mph, experienced extreme frame vibration after driving over deterioration of asphalt portion of road (which I have driven over hundreds of times with no abnormal effect).  Immediately de-accelerated and pulled over into the grassy area of the shoulder of the road.  Got out to inspected vehicle, especially the front end structure and wheels for any sign of damage; I could find none.  Carefully drove the Jeep home and again inspection the undercarriage of the vehicle for any sign of damage; none found.  Took the Jeep into a local shop for extensive inspection of the the vehicle suspension, steering, tires, etc. for any indication of damage which would have caused the above situation; none was found.  Even when I drove the Jeep after the situation, it drove normally. I had taken the Jeep in for the 48CHZ: Recall v88 recall on 20Apr20 and 48CHZ: Recall y95 (reconfiguration or power steering assist/ElectroHydraulic Power Steering (EHPS) calibrations) on 2Jul18. I am a retired Marine Corps Officer and I do not do any \"off roading\" driving with my Jeep, only normal Hi-way driving.  I have done no modifications to the front end/lift of the Jeep. Therefore, I am concerned why I have experienced this condition; possible the \"Death Wobble\" even though I have had the recall \"fix\". I can only deduce that I experienced what was called the \"Death Wooble\" which the Jeep JL was experiencing when it first came out. My Jeep only has 27,318 miles on it. Thank you for your time in this matter and I look forward to receiving some form of response. Respectfully, [XXX] LtCol.

I was on the highway in moderate traffic, when the clutch suddenly fell to the floor for no reason as I had already been in fifth gear for a while. Then the vehicle lost all power and there was a clanking noise and it seems like it was on fire with all the smoke billowing. I miraculously made it from the high speed lane over to the slow lane and luckily there was an off-ramp right there. It only made it about 50 ft and died. By the time the dealer looked at it and told me there was thousands of dollars worth of damage I couldn't believe it. All over the same thing that had been issued recalls twice already. Luckily it still was under the powertrain warranty and they took it easy on me with the rest of the parts that weren't covered. But the transmission bellhousing was sheared in half by the clutch plate or something, it cracked my thermostat housing and my thermostat . We thought there was going to be engine damage as well. The entire transmission needed to be replaced due to the fact that the clutch flywheel had broken its teeth or something like that. The entire thing was just a major, major mess. The dealership had it for over 2 months and the rental fees were killing me. The entire thing was just so disastrous. I'm just glad that it didn't kill anybody.",

On 12/3/22, I was driving on the interstate at the speed of 70 mph when my jeep began shaking vigorously and the steering became almost uncontrollable. I had to take evasive action, move over to the far right lane and slow my speed rapidly. Once my speed was under 30 mph, my jeep began driving normally again. This occurred when I drove over the beginning of a small bridge where there was a minimum change of the driving surface. As I continued driving on the interstate, the same action occurred when I drove over the next change in the surface road. This time I was only traveling at 50 mph and had to slow down to 20 mph to get the vigorous shaking to stop. I took it to my local Jeep Dealership today (12/5/22). After they inspected my jeep, I was advised that the steering damper was weak and outdated. I was also advised that they had already replaced the steering damper once due to the \"customer satisfaction note\" issued by FCA. The dealership then stated that FCA has revised the steering damper since the one that was replaced under the note but that I would have to pay for this repair because FCA hasn't issued a recall or safety notice regarding this known issue. At the low miles of 7,522 on a Jeep Wrangler that I bought brand new, I am going to have to pay for a repair to a known safety issue. Even after replacing the steering damper that they knew was defective once, I am going to have to pay for a 3rd steering damper that has been revised because the 2nd one put on by FCA was defective. This is a serious safety issue and is known by FCA but they are refusing to admit the issue and are making their customers pay for their defects. I will include a copy of my service report from the Jeep Dealership.",

Over the next couple of the times the seats were placed down it clasp wouldn\u2019t go down.  Then one day a couple months ago the seat was attempted to be put back in place, we noticed that the thin plastic retainer for the pin was broken. Depending how the seat is pushed back in place it locks sometimes and other times does not. This poses a potentially safety hazard. I originally purchased the part to replace it, however since this is a safety lock I reached out to Jeep. Jeep indicated there was no recalls on the part, even though I have seen others will the same complaint. There are several concerns with the latching seat mechanism and if you do not know its broken and the seat gets thrown forward it can be a real painful experience.  The Jeep was in for service for the top ripping multiple times and being fixed under warranty. There is anyone that could have broken the latch without telling or knowingincluding us or the dealer. Ultimately it is a ver poor design and a true safety hazard. We believe this matter needs further investigation.",

I slowed down to get off the road.  Stopped and turned off engine.  Turned it back on and nothing.  Then it just popped on.  I was able to continue on my way.  Then I started having the second issue.  Second issue to report.  The Uconnect display monitor touch screen system is delaminating and now it changes stations, systems (navigation, weather, etc) on its own. I checked the Jeep blogs and this is a consistent problem for the past 8 years.  There is an adhesive problem that Jeep/Chrysler is well aware of.  To stop this flickering of stations from happening, I have to drive with one hand and take my finger on the other hand keeping it constantly pressed against SXM button . Or turn off the radio.  This is a 4 1/2 yr old jeep with 68,000 miles. Jeep will not do anything except replace it at retail cost. I am not alone with this issue.  There are 100's of stories on the internet blogs.  This should be a recall issue to protect the consumers from extremely poor quality from a company like Chrysler.  They knew this was a quality issue jet continued producing a faulty product.  They should be better than this and held accountable.",

In researching how to fix it, I located many threads and concerns, including homemade fixes (due to costs) but many things fail causing it to fall down. One person said they were hit in the head with it. From online comments, most fail after the 3 year warranty. As mine did. Estimates online show it costs around $400 to fix. There is already limited vision in Jeep windshields, this is a major concern as the only way to fix is to hit it hard back into the socket.... while driving. I've used a hand gel container  to even my hard cell case to secure it. Thank you for considering. I believe this has been an on-going issue with Jeeps with older recalls.

On my way home from vacation, June 4, 2022, my clutch plate overheated, exploded through the bell housing and transmission, burnt the wire casing, and melted the fuel line. I had to leave my Jeep in NC and get a rental car to make it home. After being at a dealership 7 hours away from home for a week in Jacksonville, NC, I am told by the dealer that Chrysler will not honor my Powertrain warranty because the clutch is not a covered component; however, the issue that occurred with the clutch and how it occurred is exactly what both the Y03 and W12 recall said could happen. The W12 recall is still showing \"incomplete in every location I've checked, including Chrysler and Mopar; however, I am being told that the simpler fix noted in the Y03 recall supersedes the W12 recall instructions - which required service techs to perform a hydraulic clutch system bleed and also perform of clutch health check procedure; whereas the Y03 skips these steps.  I spoke to someone at MOPAR who told me that all components related to the recall (i.e. the clutch) have a 2-year warranty after the recall is completed, but any other components affected by the clutch failure are not covered.  How can Jeep/Chrysler know there is an ongoing clutch issue specifically with the clutch plate and not honor/cover repairs that result because of it? And, how can a wire sheath and software update guarantee the potential failure is resolved if the clutch is never inspected to make sure the clutch plate hasn't already been compromised because of excessive heat? I have already filed a complaint with NHSTA, spoken to Chrysler Corporate (without any luck).  Chrysler and Mopar should stand by their parts/vehicles when something catastrophic like this happens. Had the fuel line caused a fire, my Jeep could have exploded or caused a serious accident/death/injury.",

I has to drive slow, and so way could I drive it while it was raining.  It was wandering and all over the highway and the steering was not responsive.   June 3 -I brought it into Cross Jeep as soon as they had an opening.  They rotated the tire and test drive it.  I was told they did not notice anything out of the ordinary.  The loose steering is how Jeeps drive.  I was told to take it home and see how things were after the tire rotation.

It was only after slowing down the speed of the vehicle that the rattling / jumping of the steering column stopped. The uneven section of road I had gone over hadn't been that severe enough, I thought, to cause any damage. I drive over that same route several times a week and it was no different than before, other than I was driving the Jeep. I asked my wife if this had ever happened to her before. She said it had, but it stopped and she thought it may just be a wearing or broken steel belted radial tire. We were getting the tires replaced soon. After getting new tires, the problem is persisting. The mechanic did not find any damaged wheels or tires, the steering didn't appear loose or damaged. After checking this site for vehicle recalls, but finding none, I was perplexed. After conducting further research I found out about the \"Death Wobble\" and FCA's Customer Satisfaction Notification V41 Steering Damper fix.",

The visors can become detached from their main support allowing them to impede the visibility of the driver and any passengers in the vehicle.

When I attempted to steer back left to correct the vehicle straight, I was unable to move the steering wheel at all to the left resulting in me driving into a mailbox & damaged both vehicle & mailbox. Vehicle drove home fine w/out further steering issue and problem couldn't be replicated.  1/11/22: Another cold morning(appr 32 degrees), warmed car up for 15 mins(to take kids to school). Came to a 30 degree left turn & again noticed the same issue of steering locked up and unable to turn left into curve until I used both hands/arms to apply a significant amount of physical force(again barely missing a mailbox). Then I couldn't correct back to the right w/out applying same force so ended up in oncoming lane of traffic. Thankfully there was not an oncoming vehicle since I had 2 kids in the car & could've had a head on collision. Steering started working again before vehicle even came to a stop. 1/27/21: Cold morning again, warmed car up as usual, & had the same steering failure on same left hand curve as on 1/11 but this time steering ability returned quickly and safely made through the turn. Oncoming vehicle but steering returned quickly enough to avoid issues. I've since learned that FCA has a new 'campaign' out for the steering assist categorized as a 'non-safety related' repair. I'm uncertain if the 'software update' will address my steering issue as the factors outlined in it are not the same as my circumstance & correspond with a different issue being reported with the steering.?",

My Jeep had an additional recall, which the dealership performed last week, and  the dealership thought this new recall (computer update) might fix the death wobble problem.  When I picked up my Jeep last week after this second recall, my heat and A/C no longer worked--all controls on the Jeep no longer worked.  The dealership said they just followed the procedure in the recall, and since the recall resulted in the loss of my heat, A/C and defrosting, that I needed to deal with Jeep USA.  I have submitted my case to Customer Care (FCA US, LLC) at Jeep USA, and they are telling me they might be able to ship a part in 6 weeks.  My car has no heater.  No accountability.

She was told it just needed an oil change and it was safe to drive. About 10 days later my wife was driving the vehicle and the same thing happened. The vehicle was taken to our local dealer where they tried to diagnose, unable to duplicate the problem it was returned to us. We returned about 10 days later same lights coming on, this time power steering was lost. Dealership worked with Chrysler engineering and determined that the ABS module needed replaced. Work completed and Jeep was picked up. About 10 days later dash warning lights on, speedometer display out, power steering lost, back to dealership. Unable to look at at that time appointment made and returned. It is now September 30th we have cases opened with Chrysler and Mopar Warrantee. Vehicle is still at the dealership, diagnosis is now a $2000.00 chaffed wiring harness just outside the fuse box not covered by anybody. No guarantee that this will fix it. Neither will put anything in writing. I have tried to be patient, we need our vehicle. I do not feel that my family  or others are safe when it pertains to this vehicle.

HOWEVER THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE IF ONE OF KIDS EXPERIENCED THE SAME SITUATION. I DON'T FEEL SAFE TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE ON THE HIGHWAY. PLEASE ADVISE",

The shifter also was locked into place when the car eventually ended up starting. 5 mins later the car finally started up and all the of the warning lights/messages went away. I received an oil change + inspection from a dealership and nothing was found. This same problem happened again in a parking lot, (ABS, check engine, car not turning on) and I took my car to the dealership for service. They performed an inspection and I was told the ABS module needed to be replaced. About a week later I picked up my car from the dealership after they told me they fixed the issue and my car was good to go. THE SAME DAY, I had the same problem except this time it was significantly worse and extremely dangerous for myself and others. This time, WHILE driving my \"serviced\" vehicle, the ABS light, check engine light came on, dashboard stopped working, and the steering wheel also had locked while DRIVING and I was unable to turn.  I was extremely terrified and I immediately pulled the car over. After multiple attempts to start the car (same issue as before: car would not start, ABS/check engine light) I promptly took the vehicle to the dealership again. The dealership is charging me again for another inspection, hours after their service? It seems that they are using this as an opportunity to make money, rather than actually fix the issue with the vehicle. This should not be about money, this is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. The service the dealership has provided not only endangered my life, but the lives of others around me. I am extremely fortunate that this did not happen on the freeway. The dealer did not fix the problem, and in fact made the car dangerous with some of these new issues, the steering wheel locking up and the disabled dashboard. The  part they replaced did not fix my car and put me, as well as others in a DANGEROUS situation.",

        "summary": "THE CURRENT WRANGLERS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WITH STEERING. BECAUSE JEEP USED ALUMINUM STEERING BOX AND GEARS, AS OPPOSED TO STEEL, THERE IS AN UNACCEPTABLE AMOUNT OF \"PLAY\" IN THE STEERING, SPECIFICALLY ON CENTER. WHILE DRIVING AT 45MPH OR ABOVE, I CAN TURN THE WHEEL ALMOST A FULL INCH IN EITHER DIRECTION AND THE CAR DOES NOT RESPOND AT ALL. THERE OTHER DAY I WAS ON A HIGHWAY WITH UNEVEN PAVEMENT AND HAD TO SLOW DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE I COULD NOT CONTROL THE CAR.    JEEP HAS NOW ISSUED A TSB REPLACING THE ALUMINUM BOX WITH A STEEL BOX. THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HAVING THIS TSB PERFORMED STATE IT FIXES THE STEERING. I TOOK MY JEEP INTO MY DEALERSHIP 3 WEEKS AGO, WHILE HAVING JEEPCARES, THE NATIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR FCA, INVOLVED FROM THE START.    FIRST THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING BECAUSE I HAD AN \"AFTERMARKET\" LIFT. WHEN I TOLD THEN THE LIFT WAS NOT AFTERMARKET AND IS MOPAR, THEY DEMANDED A RECEIPT TO PROVE IT. I BOUGHT THE LIFT OVER 1.5 YEARS AGO SO NO LONGER HAD A RECEIPT. THE ISSUE WAS ESCALATED UP THE CORPORATE LADDER MULTIPLE TIMES UNTIL THEY FINALLY AGREED TO REPLACE THE STEERING BOX UNDER WARRANTY. THERE HAD BEEN INSTANCES OF JEEP OWNERS COMING IN FOR THIS TSB BUT DEALERSHIPS WERE NOT REPLACING THE STEERING BOX WITH THE STEEL VERSION PER THE TSB, JUST PUTTING IN ANOTHER ALUMINUM BOX. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.     THE MAIN POINT OF THIS IS THIS STEERING ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE A RECALL. THE DEALERSHIPS ARE PUTTING FORTH EVERY EFFORT NOT TO DO THE WORK. AND THE PROBLEM IS SO BAD THAT FCA IS ONLY LETTING DEALERSHIPS ORDER 1 STEERING BOX PER WEEK, DUE TO THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF JEEPS WITH DANGEROUS STEERING AND DEMAND FOR THE PART.

HOWEVER, AS THIS WAS IN THE EVENING ON A HIGH-SPEED INTERSTATE, IT WAS NOT SAFE TO PULL OVER AND TRY TO RETRIEVE THE WINDOW FROM THE DRIVING LANES SO, WE ARE NOT CERTAIN THAT THE DISLODGED WINDOW DID NOT THEN PRESENT A POTENTIAL ROAD HAZARD TO OTHER MOTORISTS.

THE WHEEL IS SLOPPY WITH A LOT OF PLAY FOR THE FIRST INCH OR TWO ON EITHER SIDE.  THE DEALER HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIX THIS ISSUE AND IT IS AN ABSOLUTE SAFETY HAZARD.  THIS IS MY ONLY PERSONAL VEHICLE SO I DON'T HAVE ANOTHER OPTION.  I PURCHASED THE JEEP BRAND NEW AND IT HAS NEVER BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT OR ABUSED.  THIS JEEP NEEDS TO BE RECALLED OR REPLACED.

IT'S A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE THAT JEEP REFUSES TO LOOK INTO AND NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED IMMEDIATELY. TRANSMISSION EXPLOSION TO THIS DEGREE NOT ONLY CAN RESULT IN A FIRE BUT ALSO METAL PROJECTILES HITTING BYSTANDERS AND COMING THROUGH THE FLOOR BOARDS AND POSSIBLY RESULTING IN INJURY OR DEATH. IF YOU ARE READING THIS AND HAVE A MANUAL JEEP WRANGLER HAVE IT CHECKED IMMEDIATELY! THIS WAS A COMPLETELY UNKNOWN PROBLEM SHOWING NO SYMPTOMS WHATSOEVER.*JB",

WHILE DRIVING I FOUND IT INCREASING DIFFICULT TO SEE THE ROAD SURFACE AND ESPECIALLY SEE THE LINES ON THE ROAD.  I HAD MY FAMILY IN THE CAR AND THE SITUATION BECAME QUITE DANGEROUS WITH A SUDDENNESS THAT I WAS UNPREPARED FOR.  ONCE I WAS ABLE TO STOP SAFELY I DISCOVERED THAT THE JEEP HEADLIGHTS WERE FULLY COVERED BY SNOW AND NOT ALLOWING LIGHT TO PASS THROUGH TO THE ROAD SURFACE.  I WIPED THE SNOW AWAY AND GOT BACK ON THE ROAD--WITHIN 10 MINUTES OR SO THE HEADLIGHTS WERE AGAIN COVERED BY SNOW WHICH ACCUMULATED ON THE SURFACE ON THE LENS. THIS CREATED ANOTHER DANGEROUS SITUATION.  APPARENTLY THE LED LIGHTS ARE NOT WARM ENOUGH TO MELT THE ACCUMULATING SNOW AND THE SURROUNDING BEZEL AREA RETAINS SNOW AS WELL. WHILE I AM NOT AN AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEER, I THINK THERE'S A DESIGN FLAW WITH THE COMBINATION OF THE GEOMETRY OF THE JEEP HEADLIGHTS AND COOLER LED LIGHTING.  IMPORTANTLY, THIS ACCUMULATION HAPPENED A SECOND TIME AFTER THE CAR WAS FULLY WARMED UP.  I HAVE DRIVEN MANY CARS OVER THE YEARS IN POOR CONDITIONS AND NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS PHENOMENON BEFORE. I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT THIS CREATED A LOT OF RISK AND DANGER FOR ME AND MY FAMILY WHILE DRIVING THE JEEP WRANGLER.

AS SOON AS MY CAR WENT BELOW 50 MPH, THE WOBBLE STOPPED. IT HAPPENS EVERY TIME I DRIVE ON THE FREEWAY NOW, ALTHOUGH NOT EVERY TIME I HIT A BUMP. THE MOST RECENT TIME WAS TODAY WHEN IT SHOOK AT ITS MOST VIOLENT PACE YET, AND I WAS ACTUALLY ONLY GOING ABOUT 55MPH WHEN IT HAPPENED. I BELIEVE IT IS GETTING WORSE. WHEN IT FIRST HAPPENED, I WAS ON A THREE HOUR DRIVE AND IT ONLY HAPPENED TWICE. ON THE WAY BACK, IT HAPPENED 3 TIMES. SINCE THEN, IT FEELS LIKE IT HAPPENS EVERY TIME I GET ON THE FREEWAY, AND USUALLY I'M ONLY ON THE FREEWAY FOR 5 MINUTES AT MOST. I HAVE HAD THE CAR SINCE JUNE. IT DIDN'T HAPPEN AT ALL UNTIL NOVEMBER 2ND AND NOW IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE DEATH WOBBLE ONCE IT STARTS IS TO SLOW THE VEHICLE DOWN UNTIL NORMAL STEERING CONTROL IS RESTORED.  AT 65 THE WHOLE JEEP SHOCK AND MY WIFE AND I WERE QUITE SCARED.  I PUT HAZARDS ON AND SLOWED TO ABOUT 10 MPH AND THE WOBBLE STOPPED.   A FEW DAYS FROM THEN WE TOOK THE NEW 2018 JEEP WRANGLER UNLIMITED WITH 3000 MILES INTO THE JEEP DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT.  THEY WERE ABLE TO REPLICATE THE DEATH WOBBLE.   THEN UPON INVESTIGATION THE DISCOVERED 'ABOUT 10 NUTS AND BOLTS THAT WERE FINGER TIGHT'.  EXACT WORDS FROM THE DEALER.

AS THIS IS A BOX FRAME AND I BELIEVE IT HAS TO BE DIPPED TO BE PRIMED AND PAINTED ON THE INNER SIDE OF THE FRAME.

I HAD RECEIVED NOTIFICATION THAT IT WAS TIME FOR MY FIRST MAINTENANCE APPOINTMENT AFTER PURCHASING THE JEEP, SO I CALLED TO SCHEDULE THAT AND ALSO TOLD THEM ABOUT THE STEERING ISSUE. ONE DAY PRIOR TO THE APPOINTMENT, MY DASHBOARD ALERT NOTIFIED ME TO \"SERVICE THE ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL\". SINCE I ALREADY HAD THE APPOINTMENT, I KNEW THIS COULD BE ADDRESSED AT THAT TIME. THEN A FEW DAYS LATER I RECEIVED THE SAFETY RECALL U48 FOR STEERING INTERMEDIATE SHAFT. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND LET THEM KNOW THAT I HAD RECEIVED THE RECALL NOTICE AND THAT I ALREADY HAD AN APPOINTMENT SCHEDULED. I TOOK THE JEEP IN FOR THE APPOINTMENT AND THE PROBLEM APPEARED TO BE FIXED AT FIRST. THEN IT HAPPENED AGAIN ABOUT A MONTH LATER AND THEN AGAIN JUST THIS PAST WEEK. IT'S A SCARY SITUATION.

I WAS PREPARING TO MOVE FROM THE INSIDE TO THE OUTSIDE LANE OF TRAVEL IN ANTICIPATION OF MAKING A RIGHT-HAND TURN. WHEN I BEGAN TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL TO THE RIGHT, IT FELT LIKE THE STEERING WAS LOCKED AND IT WAS ONLY WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORCE THAT I WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE MY LANE CHANGE. IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO APPLY ENOUGH FORCE TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY NOT APPLYING TOO MUCH SO AS TO CAUSE MYSELF TO OVERSTEER AND POTENTIAL LEAVE THE ROADWAY. WHEN I GOT TO THE INTERSECTION WHERE I NEEDED TO MAKE MY RIGHT-HAND TURN, I AGAIN HAD TO APPLY A GOOD DEAL OF FORCE TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL AND COMPLETE MY TURN. THIS CONDITION CONTINUED UNTIL I ARRIVED HOME SOME FIVE TO TEN MILES AWAY. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT IT WAS VERY HOT THAT AFTERNOON (APPROXIMATELY 95F). I HAVE READ THAT JEEP IS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND THAT THE PRIME SUSPECT IN THE CAUSE OF THIS SAFETY ISSUE IS THE NEW ALUMINUM STEERING GEAR BOX THEY INTRODUCED ON THIS MODEL. THE FACT THAT ALUMINUM HAS A GREATER THERMAL EXPANSION RATE THAN THE PREVIOUSLY USED STEEL STEERING GEARBOXES CERTAINLY WARRANTS THIS SUSPICION. I HAVE ALSO READ THAT THE MANUFACTURER HAS HAD SEVERAL \"CONFIRMED REPAIRS\" OF THIS \"STEERING LOCKUP\" ISSUE BY REPLACING THE STEERING GEARBOX WITH A RUMORED NEW, MODIFIED ONE. WITH THESE CONSIDERATIONS IN MIND, I BELIEVE THE HIGH TEMPERATURES OF THAT DAY CONTRIBUTED TO THE EXPANSION OF MY JEEP'S ALUMINUM GEARBOX CAUSING IT TO BIND UP AND LOCK THE STEERING. A FURTHER INDICATION THAT THIS MIGHT BE THE CASE IS THE FACT THAT HOURS LATER AFTER BOTH THE VEHICLE AND THE AMBIENT TEMPERATE HAD COOLED, THE STEERING RETURNED TO NORMAL.",
