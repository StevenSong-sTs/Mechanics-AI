THIS WENT ON FOR ANOTHER ROUNDTRIP THE FOLLOWING DAY.  UPON RETURNING HOME THE FOLLOWING DAY I SAW SOMETHING HANGING FROM UNDERNEATH THE VEHICLE.  IT WAS THE SKID PLATE, HANGING BY THE PASSENGER'S SIDE BOLTS, SUPPORTING THE ENTIRE WEIGHT OF THE DRIVETRAIN.  THE DRIVESHAFT BEING AT THAT UNNATURAL ANGLE IS WHAT CAUSED THE LOSS OF POWER.  TO THINK THAT I HAD DRIVEN 100 MILES THAT WAY WAS SLIGHTLY UNSETTLING.  SINCE THEN I HAVE HAD THE FRAME WELDED, WHICH RAN $1,200.  I HAVE SINCE HAD THE REAR RAILS (BEHIND REAR WHEELS) REPAIRED FOR AN ADDITIONAL $400.  MY FRONT BODY MOUNT HAS ALSO ROTTED OUT, WHICH I FIXED MYSELF FOR $10, BUT SHOULD PROBABLY BE WELDED BY A PROFESSIONAL.  BOTH MECHANIC AND WELDER SUGGESTED THAT FRAME ROT OCCURRED DUE TO LACK OF HOLES FOR WATER TO DRAIN OUT AND THAT THE SITTING WATER AND SALT JUST ATE AWAY AT EVERYTHING.  THE CAR NOW HAS 215,000 MILES ON IT.  I AM OTHERWISE HAPPY WITH THE CAR, BUT IT UPSETS ME THAT I COULD HAVE HAD A MAJOR ACCIDENT DUE TO THE POOR DESIGN OF THE FRAME.  SEEMS STRANGE THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A FIX FOR THE ISSUE, NOR A RESPONSE FROM CHRYSLER TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE CAN DIE AS A RESULT OF THE FRAME ROTTING OUT.  MAYBE THAT'S WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN FOR A FIX?!?  AT 200,000+ MILES YOU WOULD THINK I WOULD GO STRAIGHT BACK TO A WRANGLER ONCE THIS ONE BITES IT, BUT I WILL NEVER BUY A JEEP AGAIN BASED ON THIS ISSUE.  I BOUGHT THIS AS A 25 YEAR OLD WITHOUT KIDS.  WITH A 2 AND 4 YEAR OLD AT HOME, I WOULD NOT TRUST A JEEP TO TRANSPORT THEM (TOO BAD, AS MY SON LOVES MY JEEP DESPITE NEVER BEING IN IT).

A QUICK INTERNET SEARCH REVEALED THE FRAME ROT IS A VERY COMMON DESIGN FLAW FOR THE WRANGLER TJ SERIES. APPARENTLY MOISTURE, ROAD DEBRIS, ETC.

SINCE THIS CREATES A CONDITION THAT ALLOWS THE FRAME TO ROT FROM THE INSIDE-OUT, BY THE TIME IT IS DISCOVERED IT IS TYPICALLY TOO LATE.

MY CASE IS TYPICAL OF THE FAILURES DESCRIBED BY OTHER 2001 WRANGLER OWNERS IN THAT THE HEATER BLOWER FAN SWITCH BEGAN TO DROP SPEEDS UNTIL ONLY THE HIGHEST SPEED WAS LEFT OPERATIONAL [WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS HOW THE UNDERLYING ELECTRONICS SPECIFICALLY A RESISTOR BANK FAIL IN THIS MODEL].  RECENTLY, THIS 4TH SPEED HAS FAILED AND I AM NOT DRIVING THE VEHICLE UNTIL I CAN RECEIVE SOME ASSURANCE THAT THE HEATER BLOWER WILL NOT CONTINUE TO HEAT UP UNTIL IT CATCHES FIRE AS HAS BEEN REPORTED IN OTHER INSTANCES.  AS I WRITE THIS COMPLAINT, IT IS ABOUT 25 DEGREES OUTSIDE, SO DRIVING MY 2001 WRANGLER WITHOUT HEAT IS NOT AN OPTION.  I GUESS I AM LUCKY THAT (A) IT FAILED COMPLETELY IN COLD WEATHER FORCING ME TO (B) RESEARCH THE ISSUE LEARNING THAT (C) THIS OBVIOUS VEHICLE DEFECT CAN RESULT IN THE WRANGLER CATCHING FIRE WHICH HAS FORCED ME TO (D) GO WITHOUT THE USE OF THE WRANGLER UNTIL A FACTORY DESIGNED AND SPONSORED FIX IS ENGINEERED AND INSTALLED.

THEY DO NOT CLOSE AND SECURE FULLY AS THE DOOR IS AJAR UNTIL YOU RE-CLOSE THE DOOR WITH FORCE.    4. BREAK NOISE. I GET A CONSISTENT CLACK NOISE WHEN APPLYING THE BREAKS. I HAVE HAD THE DEALERSHIP WORK ON THIS PROBLEM ON FIVE OCCASIONS TO INCLUDE A COMPLETE BREAK SERVICE. THE PROBLEM IS STILL THERE.     4. BUILD QUALITY. SINCE I BOUGHT THE WRANGLER I HAVE HAD THE RADIATOR REPLACED (IT LEAKED), ALL THE SPARK PLUGS REPLACED (ROUGH IDLE), INSIDE RIGHT DOOR HANDLE ASSIST AND SNAP ON FRONT FLOOR MAT REPLACED, THE COMPUTER REPROGRAMMED (THEY SAID THE FACTORY DID NOT DO IT RIGHT), FUEL PUMP REPLACED (GAS LEAK), SEALS AROUND GAS TANK AND GAS CAP (VAPOR LEAK), AND THE REAR SEALS (WHICH WERE NOT COVERED UNDER MY CHRYSLER EXTENDED WARRANTY).     5.

I ALSO GET APPROXIMATELY 80 MILES LESS TO THE TANK ON GAS MILEAGE.  I HAVE TALKED TO NUMEROUS PERSONS OF WHOM OWN JEEPS, 2000 OR NEWER AND THEY HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  MOST OF THESE WERE NOTICED WHILE STILL UNDER FACTORY WARRANTY, SO THE PROBLEMS WERE SIMPLY FIXED.  ESSENTIALLY THEY WERE GIVEN A NEW GAS TANK AND FUEL LINES TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  I WOULD JUST LIKE TO PUT OUT THERE THAT THERE IS A STRONG SMELL OF FUEL WHICH COULD LEAD TO A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE HAS COMPLAINED OF THIS OR HAD ANY PROBLEMS OF THIS KIND.  HAVE A WONDERFUL WEEKEND.  KEVIN CHAMPAIGNE.   *JB",
