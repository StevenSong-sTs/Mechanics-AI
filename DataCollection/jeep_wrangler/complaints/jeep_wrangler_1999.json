I'M ABOUT READY TO CUT THE WIRES AND SOLDER THEM DIRECTLY ON. 2ND ISSUE: I BEGAN SMELLING PLASTIC BURNING OR SOMETHING. LATER THE HEATER FAN QUIT WORKING. AFTER SOME READING OF THE SERVICE MANUAL, I CHECKED A LOT OF PARTS AND FOUND THE CONTROL/SELECTOR SWITCH UNIT HEATED UP AND PARTIALLY MELTED THE WIRING HARNESS  AS WELL AS BURNT INSIDE THE UNIT. BOUGHT ANOTHER AND REPLACED IT. WORKS GREAT NOW. ALL THE FAN POSITIONS WORK AGAIN.  THIS SWITCH HAS TO BE REPLACED SO OFTEN I JUST LEAVE THE SCREWS FROM THE CENTER DASH PANEL OFF.

NEVER HEARD OF IT. I HAVE COMPLETELY REMOVED THE DASH LOOKING FOR PROBLEMS. BAD GROUNDS? I CAN'T TELL WHERE. I SUSPECT THE PLUGS THE CLUSTER SLIPS INTO. I'VE TRIED TO PULL THE MOUNTS CLOSER FOR A BETTER CONNECTION. IT SEAMED TO WORK FOR A WHILE. THEN IT COMES BACK. A GOOD SOUND BEATING ON THE DASH BRINGS THEM BACK ON. AMAZING WHAT THAT PLASTIC WILL TAKE. ALL THIS STARTED AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRED. I REFUSE TO TAKE IT IN AND POUR MONEY AT IT TILL THEY FIGURE IT OUT.   ALL I WANT IS TO KNOW HOW TO FIX THE GAUGES. I'M ABOUT READY TO CUT THE WIRES AND SOLDER THEM DIRECTLY ON.    2ND ISSUE:  I BEGAN SMELLING PLASTIC BURNING OR SOMETHING. LATER THE HEATER FAN QUIT WORKING. AFTER SOME READING OF THE SERVICE MANUAL, I CHECKED A LOT OF PARTS AND FOUND THE CONTROL/SELECTOR SWITCH UNIT HEATED UP AND PARTIALLY MELTED THE WIRE PLUGGING INTO IT AS WELL AS BURNT INSIDE THE UNIT. BOUGHT ANOTHER AND REPLACED IT. WORKS GREAT NOW. ALL THE FAN POSITIONS WORK AGAIN.  *JB",

I HAD TO CALL JEEP TO FIND OUT IF IT WAS COVERED UNDER A WARRANTY, THE WARRANTY ENDED AT 70000 MILES. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO SEVERAL DIFFERENT PLACES FOR ESTIMATES AND INFORMTION. NONE SAID THAT THE CRACKS, TWO AT TWO DIFFERENT SPOTS, COULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN 4000 MILES. ONE IS LOCATED ON A TIGHT BEND ON THE PIPE. I ASKED THE MANAGER OF THE DEALERSHIP WHAT COULD CAUSE THIS PROBLEM, HE SAID THAT TEMPETURE CHANGES. THE DEALERSHIP ALSO NEVER TOLD ME THAT IT WAS TWO CRACKS. JUST SAID THERE WAS ONE. THEY ALSO SAID THEY DID NOT DETECT IT THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE MAYBE IT WAS NOT AS ABVIOUS. THE LOCATIONS OF ONE OF THE CRACKS CAN EASILY BE SEEN IF ONE CHANGES THE OIL, THE OTHER CAN BE SEEN BY LIGTING THE HOOD AND LOOKING DOWN THE SIDE OF THE ENGINE. THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEF THAT THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT COMPLETE A MAJOR CHECK OF THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME OF THE MAJOR SERVICE.

WITH HIS FOOT FIRMLY ON THE BRAKE, HE SHIFTED INTO DRIVE, SUDDENLY THE ENGINE REVVED HIGH, AND THE VEHICLE LUNGED FORWARD, STRIKING A TOYOTA RAV4 PARKED IN FRONT.
