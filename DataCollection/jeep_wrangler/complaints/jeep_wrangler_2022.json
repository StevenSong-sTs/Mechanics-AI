        "summary": "While driving over 50mph, I encountered issues with stablization where the steering wheel would violently shift left and right, and the vehicles front tires were wobbling uncontrollably until lowering speeds below 30mph.  After the dealer replaced the steering damper, I ran into this problem again but much worse as I was driving 70mph on the Interstate. After almost losing control multiple times I was able to take back roads home.  This is a huge safety issue as I had my baby in the vehicle and the issue is still occurring. Upon looking under the vehicle I noticed the steering damper free floating and the bolt was missing for the wheel. I'm not sure if the bolt assembly is bent but it appears the replacement by the dealer is inadequate.",

Its horrible I cant charge the vehicle and now I cant put gas in it either.",

This happened on the highway on my way to work. I lost time at work as well as my car for 34 days. (This is the second time it has happened).

I have thankfully been able to get myself off the road in all of these instances without causing an accident. There have been several break downs where I had to have someone come get me, and I have had it towed several times to the dealership as well. I have broken down entirely on the highway several times, slowing to a stop and having people needing to drive around me, or stop to help. I have taken the vehicle in many, many times and have been without my car for over 40 days (if I counted, it would be over 60 days). The dealership has told me it's a 4xe problem, but then lists the problem on paper as various things (coolant leaks, high voltage battery problem). At this point, I am afraid to drive it, as I have 1 active recall with no remedy available and a few alerts. My check engine light came on again this morning with no reasoning behind it, and the Jeep says to check ABS braking system and electrical systems. It's my very expensive daily driver. It has been inspected by two dealerships, with me taking into one dealership at least 12 times for recalls and repairs.",

The recall pertains to a potential fire risk associated with the high-voltage battery pack. While I appreciate Chrysler\u2019s efforts to address this safety concern, I have serious reservations about the effectiveness of the proposed remedy.  1.Safety Concerns: I am worried about the safety of my vehicle\u2019s battery. The recall notice indicated that a battery pack may contain cells with separator damage that could lead to a vehicle fire. I find it concerning that the proposed remedy primarily involves a software update and inspection, rather than an immediate battery replacement, especially given the potential risks involved. 2.Request for Action: I urge the NHTSA to investigate this matter further and consider whether the proposed remedy adequately addresses the safety risks posed by the high-voltage battery. I believe that consumers deserve clear information and effective solutions when it comes to potential safety defects in their vehicles.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I was going less than 10 miles an hour.  Jeep has a max regeneration function that uses the engine to generate an EV battery recharge.  I understand that the max regen sort of turns off when you are rolling at really low speeds, but it seems the transition to/from this is rough on the transmission or something. This only happens at low speeds (in parking lots, etc)  This behavior happens intermittently but, this is the first time I was not able to stop completely before an impact occured.",

Yay! Ours was at just over 17k miles.  Now, on top of all of this, I receive a notice for our fourth recall in 2 years, for a battery that could randomly catch fire and there is no fix known yet. The charger for the Jeep is literally right outside my children's bedrooms. If I want to charge my vehicle, I am potentially risking a fire right next to where my kids sleep. If I don't plug in, the whole point of us picking the plug-in hybrid is a total waste of our money. I also have to park next to an apartment building, let alone my other coworkers' vehicles when I go to work. I now feel like my vehicle is a ticking time bomb.   I would love to be able to end my lease early to get out of this nightmare.  At the very least is there an option for a loaner vehicle or rental reimbursement until this potentially extremely dangerous issue is repaired?",

They told me the work was complete; I returned to pick up my vehicle and found out the work had not been done because they didn't have the parts, so I took my vehicle home.  I'm now told that they actually ordered the parts for the recall without telling me, and I was never informed that the parts arrived at the dealership or were going to be returned after that.    I have now brought my vehicle to a different dealership (Helfman in Houston) for a repair and to have that recall fixed.  They are unable to order the parts from Jeep to fix the recall, because River Oaks had previously ordered them under my VIN and have most likely returned them. No one at River Oaks is willing to help in any way.  The recall manager says I should have known that they received the parts in stock after I left without any kind of notification, and the parts managers won't answer or return my calls.  Jeep corporate has stated that they cannot cancel the previous parts order, but that River Oaks can cancel the previous order so that Helfman can put in a new one with my VIN. River Oaks has denied this.   At this point, I cannot get a mandated safety recall fixed on my Jeep because of the previous and ongoing actions of River Oaks dealership.

It has lost all power and shut off several times, Jeep continues to say there is no issue. The loss of power is concerning because it happens when driving on busy roadways.

I started bringing in the wrangler at 35,500 miles still under bumper to bumper warranty but because it was a stored code there was no repair order issued. This continued until around 50k miles when the jeep started shutting off at low speeds. The dealer took it in and Jeep Corporate stated that because it was still a stored code they would not release the battery pack needed for the repair. The dealer fought the warranty department for 3 weeks holding on to my vehicle. They eventually returned the car to me un-repaired per Jeep Corp instruction.  The check engine light came on days after it was returned to me. No repair but documented at dealer.  12 days after the car was repaired it died again rolling to a stop light and then again in the same trip. The second time, it died in rush hour traffic, with a semi truck behind me. Thankfully I was traveling at about 20 miles an hour and the semi had several car lengths behind me because it shut off as though it was so dead it was sitting in my driveway. It did start back up when I placed it in park. I drove it to the dealer where they kept it for 2 more months fighting warranty to release the battery pack. I went through five jeep cares case managers and had multiple \u201cstar cases\u201d that were opened and closed without the dealership being made aware at times that they were closed.  They finally approved the repair. I have had the vehicle returned to me and plan to sell it as soon as possible because I do not know when this next battery pack will fail.",

The Samsung EV battery was fully charged, indicating a 99% charge available, which translates to an approximate 24 mile range on the EV motor. The check engine light (CEL) came on as well as a \"charging system failure\" message came on in the center of the message center. The Jeep dealership in Temecula, CA, received the Jeep, which would only operate on the Internal Combustion Engine, and even then at 50% of available power, with the a/c system non-operable. The Internal Combustion Engine would not respond to throttle input, where it would not start (from engine off mode) more than a dozen times while en route to the Jeep dealership. It was unsafe being at the front of a long-line of cars when a light turned green and then applying the throttle, nothing happened, where we very nearly got rear-ended on multiple occasions. The DCH Temecula dealership who is servicing the Jeep advises the Samsung EV battery had an internal failure and requires replacement. The Samsung EV battery is on order or in transit/shipping, has not arrived. We have been without the Jeep approaching a month. In addition to our concern for this happening to others, we are really concerned about this being a recurring issue and problem.",

I left your facility in the Bronx at 1:40 PM yesterday and was on the side of the [XXX] at approximately 3:30 PM in Dix Hills [XXX]. **** spoke to your Manager **** and recommended that I have it towed to the closest Jeep dealer. The Jeep is now at the Huntington Jeep service center in Commack at 5080 Jericho Turnpike. After waiting for a tow for almost two hours we arrived at Huntington Jeep. The service shop was closed for the day and I am without a car and have no loaner car. I expect Riverdale to have a loaner car in my driveway tomorrow morning. Attached is also the receipt from the tow I need to be reimbursed on. See also pictures of Jeep on flatbed tow truck.  The fact of the matter is that I asked about the open clutch recall and was assured that your maintenance team went through the Jeep and took care of any open items. This was not true, as per the attached open recall I just found on the Mopar recall site. It clearly says this VIN# Jeep was not addressed and the exact description in the recall is what happened to me. The Jeep indeed smelled like it was going to go on fire. The fact that you guys sent me on my way with what could have been a very dangerous situation because you neglected to disclose the correct information on the recall. I could have been killed someone near my vehicle could have been killed, because I know for a fact something shot out of the transmission housing and the car behind me had to swerve out of the way. I fortunately was able to get to the side of the parkway safely.  I still have no correspondence from either dealer regarding a fix/repair a week later and no loaner car or rental. Yesterday I gave Riverdale Chrysler Jeep the opportunity to reimburse me in full and I have no response. INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

        "summary": "A vehicle cross my path required full application of braking, locking all 4 wheels.  During this event, the automatic ignition shutoff (AIS) was enabled.  As a result of AIS and the lack of ABS, and, hence a 4 wheel lock-up, the AIS shutoff the engine, causing loss of power steering and power brakes.    The resulting vehicle behavior required immediate and severe steering wheel correction with substantial additional force to prevent a collision with the vehicle in my path.  Had I not previously had driver safety training as well as significant high performace driving experience I likley would have collided with the other vehicle.  My assertion is the combination of AIS and the lack of ABS resulting in 4 wheel lock may had led to a collision resulting in sever injury to the other driver.",

        "summary": "This vehicle continues to have \"Death Wobble\" (violent shaking of stearing & suspension) when driving at or above 55 mph speeds. The current odometer mileage of vehicle is approximately 23,500 miles.   The problem first occurred at around 9,000 miles at highway speeds. The dealer was promptly contacted and a replacement steering dampener was installed. The problem has returned at even lower speeds under any number of normal driving conditions.   Problem occurs when tires cross any road boundary, road inconsistencies, or pavement changes at speed 55+ mph. The immediate sensation that stearing is failing or falling apart is only mitigated by immediate deceleration. This is extremely unsafe when attempting to maintain flow of traffic speeds on freeways or other roads.   Stellantis, FCA, Jeep, etc. Has attempted to band-aid this problem by providing steering dampener replacement when harmonic vibration amplification is the main problem, based on various inerworkings of the deficient suspension & steering components on newer vehicles.   This Jeep has not been modified in any way from factory settings and configurations. Work has ONLY been performed on the vehicle by certified jeep technicians.",

        "summary": "I am writing to express my serious concern regarding the safety recall initiated by FCA US for the Jeep Wrangler 4xe. This recall, which pertains to an internally failed HV battery, poses a significant safety risk to vehicle occupants, bystanders, and property.  As stated in the summary provided by FCA US, an internally failed HV battery in the affected vehicles could lead to a vehicle fire, regardless of whether the ignition is on or off. This presents an alarming safety hazard, as a vehicle fire not only increases the risk of occupant injury but also poses a threat to individuals outside the vehicle and can result in substantial property damage.  While it is commendable that FCA US has initiated a voluntary safety recall to address this issue, the proposed remedy raises several concerns. The instruction for customers to refrain from recharging these vehicles and to avoid parking them inside buildings or structures, or near other vehicles until the final repair is completed, is deeply troubling.   This instruction places an undue burden on affected vehicle owners, as it significantly disrupts their daily routines and raises questions about the practicality and feasibility of implementing such precautions. Furthermore, it fails to provide a comprehensive solution to mitigate the risk of vehicle fires effectively.  Moreover, the solution is completely ineffective as it puts the liability back on the customer since FCA will not deem the vehicle inoperable. This refusal to acknowledge the severity of the safety risk and to take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of vehicle occupants is unacceptable.  I urge thorough investigation by NHTSA into the root cause, that they ensure transparent communication by FCA, and accountability for FCA's inadequate response.  Failure to address this promptly endangers lives and property. Please prioritize this critical issue.",

        "summary": "On 12/28/2023, my wife was traveling on the highway at normal operating speed when she encountered the front end of our 2022 Jeep Wrangler begin violently shaking.  I looked over the jeep to inspecting for any visual cues, but could see none.  I thought maybe it was something in the road, so I drove it on the highway, all seemed well until I began to travel over a bridge and I thought the front end of the jeep was going to come apart (literally).  I limped the jeep back home and immediately contacted the jeep dealer I bought it from.  The dealership said it's a known problem, I was so furious that a product could be sold with a known problem like that.  I left it with the dealership to repair and was told there is no grantee this will fix the problem permanently.  My wife said she won't drive it any longer for fear that it may happen again.  What can I do as a consumer?",

The vehicle then displayed a message to shift to P to start the engine. But it wouldn\u2019t let me shift to P while going 50+ mph. I managed to coast to a relatively safe area on the shoulder of the highway with minimal disruption of traffic, bring the car to a full stop, and restart the engine. However if I had been in the far left lane of the highway instead of the far right, or in a section without a safe shoulder, this event could have been the start of a major accident, endangering myself and many others. The spontaneous total loss of driving power in the 4xe is an inexcusable public safety risk. I know there has been a previous recall for a different issue that also produced this effect. This issue must also be fixed.",

        "summary": "Installed a factory Jeep Fox 2\" lift kit after reaching 700 miles on new 2022 Sahara. Checked and rechecked all torque specifications and took to dealer the next day for an alignment. They straightened the steering wheel which is a normal requirement when installing a lift. After about one month, I had an occurrence of the \"death wobble\". This is my 5th Jeep Wrangler, some with lifts, some without, so I am aware of the wobble when hitting a bump around 50-55mph and how to handle it. I rechecked all the specs on each bolt touched during lift install. I don't drive it much and baby it so it took a while before it happened again. Last week, 3 time on same highway around 55mph ON A STRAIGHT highway I experienced the wobble. I found a great diagnosis blog which led to the discovery of both tie rod ends failing and making 'clunking' noise man manually twisted by hand. I took to the dealer who had to order parts. There was no mention of stock tire balancing or steering damper replacement like in other complaints, however I have not recieved my Jeep back yet to verify the problem is fixed. Everything on the vehicle is stock other than the Mopar/Fox lift kit from the dealer. I requested another alignment and I'm curious to see the numbers compared to 1 year ago. The camber and caster is not adjustable and the tires were rotated once already and only have about 8700 miles on them. The obvious culprit I found as a consumer was the tie rod ends which have been described in many Jeep forums as being sub-par and junk. If my wife would drive this Jeep with my two young children and experienced the wobble for the first time on her own, there is no doubt she could crash into a fellow motorist. I always have to slow down and pull to the shoulder....I'm not sure how she'd react. Dangerous and noted multiple times on this site and Jeep forums. Make JEEP fix this issue as it has been around for YEARS!",

The letter also indicated that \u201ca remedy for this condition is not currently available\u201d.

I live in the mountains of Colorado and my first heavy wet snowstorm I drove home in at night on my dangerous windy tight canyon road home the headlights as well as the factory fog lights got completely covered in snow and ice to the point were I had to pull over about 10 times on my 10 mile drive home to clear the lights off as they got so covered that the light was completely gone to the point of not being able to see anything...not the reflectors on the side of the road or anything at all. I've never seen anything like it. Even though you can see dim light through the snow and ice the actual light emitted in this state is unusable. I risked getting hit every time I had to stop in the middle of the road (no shoulders just a cliff to the river below and cliff walls on the other side) to clear the lights off to get another straightaway down the road. This was terrifying and I think Jeep and Stelantis should recall these lights and replace them with Heated units like cars in Europe are mandated to have. This is such a safety issue and my solution will be to install some aftermarket old school halogens but this should still be addressed because somebody could get killed in their first bad snowstorm with these lights. They work fantastic in most conditions but when in a bad snowstorm these lights are totally useless and it is not safe to stop in the middle of the road when no shoulder exists to clear these lights over and over. Please address this and hopefully other people have filed complaints over this as well, I can't believe I'm the only one and the Jeep forums are full of threads about this!

When the Jeep ran out of electric battery and transitioned to hybrid mode the engine completely shut down and she had almost no time to make it from the middle lane to the side of the highway without accident. Multiple cars and large semis had to break suddenly to avoid rear-ending the Jeep. After getting to the side of the highway the Jeep would not restart or shift to neutral. An extremely dangerous situation and thankfully the police showed up to divert traffic.   With all of this said, I took my Jeep to the dealer in December 2022 to fix the loss of motive power recall (ZB7), and from this most recent experience, that recall fix either did not work or Jeep should issue another recall. An extremely dangerous situation when the Jeep shuts off at highway speed with no advance warning.  Called JeepWave customer service on 3/1 and case #85607518 was opened with the promise that a Jeep case manager will reach out in 2-3 days to address my safety concerns.  My Jeep is currently at the dealership and fingers crossed that when/if I get it back this does not happen again. We feel very lucky with the outcome as it could have been much worse with speeds decreasing from 65 MPH to 0  with no advance warning.",

No previous experience or difficulties with vehicle but when temperatures lowered to freezing for the first time, the vehicle had significantly diminished performance on stability.  After the initial death wobble, carefully driving the wheel continued to pulsate when hitting cracks in the pavement (wheels going into a downward bump, bumps in the up direction did not impact steering as heavily). Took more than 9 weeks to be see by the Dealerships after calling multiple dealers and working with Jeepwave- warranty. After the vehicle was confirm to have a Front Track Bar defect and Steering Dampener defect, the dealer informed me the car \"was safe to drive\" until parts were available with a 5-6 week window before they'd arrive - due to another defect my vehicle was in the shop for most of that. Upon return of the vehicle, immediate test drive by myself noted the steering is now improved but still inconsistently experiencing the steering wheel shaking (no vibration in the pedals but vibration is noticable for passengers sitting in the vehicle). Called the Dealership again, was told this is just the 1st fix they've been told to try and it'll be another 3 weeks prior to the dealership bringing the vehicle in for \"additional diagnostics\" without a clear plan for what parts they plan to replace next.  Concern for me to send this note - the Vehicle at speeds as low as 62 mph starts to have a pulsating wheel that if roads are icy, an unsuspecting person were to drive my brand new vehicle with only 6,500 miles at this point, or a particular bump arises and fully loses control. Jeep knew of the issue and did not expedite my ability to get into a dealer - they played dumb on the issue until it was in the shop. There has been no urgency on my driving this vehicle as they deem it \"safe to drive\".",

Vehicle abruptly lost all motive power and went to electric only mode with a top speed of about 3-4 mph showing a red turtle icon on dash and \u201cService Hybrid Electrical Vehicle System\u201d and \u201cService Charging System\u201d messages.  After stopping to investigate, vehicle could not be shifted out of park or moved.   Vehicle required tow for repair  A few hours before this occurred, vehicle experienced two short intervals of similar loss of power, both of which abated within less than a few seconds.  Most concerning is that this occurred after recall 22V-865 was performed, indicating that the safety issue is unresolved by that recall or is an independent issue.   Total and unanticipated loss of power creates a safety issue in our hilly and populated terrain.",

On 12/17/2022 I was driving my 2022 completely stock (unmodified) Jeep Wrangler 4x4 on a paved city street at approximately 55 mph. Suddenly, without any warning whatsoever, the vehicle began violently shaking and the steering wheel was pulled out of my control. I was barely able to control the Jeep and the violent shacking was extremely difficult to control and keep in my lane. The vehicle continued shaking until I was able to come to a complete stop. This incident occurred In traffic, at 55 mph, and without warning. Vehicle\u2019s behind me also had to emergency brake due to my panic and cars in the opposite lane had to swerve as the violent shaking caused my car to to cross into oncoming traffic.  I contacted the Jeep dealer who I bought the car from and they were TOTALLY AWARE of the problem and called it \u201cDEATH WOBBLE.\u201d Dealer further stated they have no way of guaranteeing they can fix it.  Please investigate this! Someone is going to die. This is totally unacceptable and should be stopped! I am now without a car and Jeep/Chrysler continue to sell these cars with full knowledge of this ongoing DANGER. I will never trust this vehicle.   This vehicle has never been taken off-road or involved in an accident. I have never been late on a payment. I am stuck with a vehicle that has a known, severely dangerous problem. Please investigate this. I am lucky to be alive.  Upon reviewing this incident on the net there are numerous complaints of DEATH WOBBLE, numerous. This problem is terrifying!

My headlights also lacked any beam distance at all. I was forced to reduce speed to 10 miles per hour unless other cars headlight were illuminating the area Infront of my car. My friend was still able to go 40mph safely and comfortably. Traffic was passing me constantly on the snowy road due to my inability to go a reasonable speed and having nowhere safe to stop. Upon stopping I found a caked layer of snow on both headlights complete diffusing their beam into every direction including vertically up into the snowflakes that had been so disruptive to my ability to see. On the remainder of the drive home I had to stop Every 15 minutes  (5 times) to clear the snow from the lenses. The diffusion of the beam also meant that while my beams were less bright, they were always in the eyes of oncoming traffic and I would regularly get flashed with high beams to let me know.",

I called the Redlands Jeep dealership around 8 am. I came in for an appointment on Friday, the 4th and the same violent shaking occurred around the same mileage. The person who inspected my vehicle told me to not drive on the freeway anymore and that it may have been a problem with my tires in terms of the tires needing to be balanced. Later on, a representative called and said that the issue was not with the tires and was with the Steering Damper.

I've seen that others have been having this issue and there's even a lawsuit regarding this. I had two passengers in the car with me and I was driving at night with a line of cars behind me down a windy road and could have caused a pile up.   When I first got in the car, the pure gas range was around 135 miles. I put the car in electric and drove for about 3 minutes till I arrived at my destination. Right after I put the car in park, the low fuel sign came on but there was still around 126 miles left of gas so I was very confused. I drove for another 5 minutes and this time the fuel dropped down to 34 miles. So within a matter of minutes, I lost 100 miles in gas range. I went to fuel the car and when I turned it off and on, the low fuel sign disappeared and the car was back to 126 miles of gas range before I even put any additional fuel into it. I figured this was just a fuel sensor issue and ignored it. After I added fuel, it drove fine for 30 minutes or so and then as I was driving home, I noticed that the car seemed to just suddenly slow down and I got a warning sign to put my car in park and turn it off and on. I was able to pull to the side but I noticed that on the side where you can choose between, electric, hybrid, and e-save, all of the options were not lighted. It appeared as though the engine had stalled. Once I restarted the car, it ran fine. I do not believe I received a check engine light or any other warning signs except for the car telling me to restart and once I did, everything went away.  Some folks on the 4xe forum said to check the fusebox and 90% of the fuses were loose or not seated properly. However, this should not be related to the fuel sensor issue. Brought it to a dealership and they said nothing was wrong with it and no codes came up.",

The ignition was turned off but all warning lights continued to flash and there were audible beeping.  The vehicle had locked itself into an \"Auto Park\" mode, and it was unable to be driven or placed into gear. The battery was disconnected, allowing the computer to reset.  Although the vehicle continued to malfunction, I was able to drive it out of the main traffic and into a parking lot. A wrecker was called, and the vehicle was transported to a local Jeep dealership.  The local dealership kept the vehicle for several days, and tested it extensively. They were able to reproduce the loss of steering. They found some erroneous solders on a component, the \"Star Connector\". It is believed that this may have shorted something in the electrical system.  The safety of myself and family and all others in the vicinity of the Jeep 4xe were in grave danger when the initial brake, steering and engine failure occurred. Other people may well have been run over during this event.  The problem of loss of steering was reproduced by the Jeep dealership that worked on the 4xe, and they feel that it was corrected by replacing the Star Connector.

The vehicle was not fixed until 5/4/22.  The check engine light went on for a second time on 5/29/22.  When taking the vehicle to my local auto store the report indicated another \"coolant\" issue.  This should not be happening on a new car with less than 4,000 miles on it and 3 months old.  This issue has been confirmed by Liberty Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram located at 1000 E Park Avenue, Libertyville Illinois 60048.    I am concerned for several reasons.  (1) This could be a sign of additional issues, especially with under 5,000 miles on the vehicle.  (2) I am concerned that unless this issue is fixed completely by Jeep the vehicle is at risk for serious malfunction while driving which would put the safety of myself along with anyone driving or in the vehicle at risk for a serious accident and even the possibility of death. (3) I am also concerned that continuous coolant malfunctions will put the engine block at risk which would be a serious safety and financial issue.  The more stress on the engine and components the lifespan of the vehicle could be diminished and resale value severely affected.    There were not indications of anything wrong with the vehicle prior to the check engine light coming on both instances.    The vehicle is available for inspections upon request.",

During the test drive, while driving on the highway at 70 mph, I expressed my concern about the steering wheel acting out and feeling loose. It was a very short drive. The dealership personnel reassured me that everything was fine with the car and I would be safe while driving it. I was ready to drive back home to Corpus Christi. Unfortunately, the 140 mi ride turned into a nightmare. After speeding to 60 mph on the highway, the car started acting weird. The wheel felt loose, the steering not under control. The next curve on the road, and I completely lost control over the car; the car just went into the right lane, and I was lucky the truck behind managed to stop. And then it happened again when I was slowing down.  I had to stop to calm down. I was shaking and was scared to keep driving home. It took me over 3 hours to get home\u2014the most extended 3 hours ever. I kept the speed 50 mph and below the whole time, and my sister was driving behind me.  On 03/05/2022 the vehicle was at the dealership in Corpus Christi to be checked and the problem fixed. They test drove it, find a wobble when hitting a bump, changed a part.  The main problem of the loose steering wheel hasn't been fixed. At higher speeds the wheel goes left and right, and the car does not follow; I don't have control of the vehicle and it goes into the right lane on its own. Very unsafe!",
