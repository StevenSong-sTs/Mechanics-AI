It was changed out by the Pep Boys I do not have it on hand but upon research it appears that this is a known issue on the 3.6 and the 3.2 Chrysler Pentastar engines. Mopar made this part out of entirely plastic and it is now failing on a ton of vehicles. The replacement parts are all made out of metal/aluminum.  Safety: this not only put myself at a safety risk but also puts other motorists on the road at risk. Not to mention the environmental safety that this can cause.   The plastic part contains the oil filter for the engine. After time it warps and fails causing cracks and seal leaks that allows oil to drain out of the engine, onto the transmission manifold and all over the ground/road. There is no warning for this, one day you will walk out and find your vehicle bleeding all of its oil all over the pavement. This could happen to anyone at any time. I would hate to be on a motorcycle driving behind a Chrysler engine when their engine decides to fall apart and slick up the expressway with motor oil. Jeep/Chrysler knows that this is happening, they know it\u2019s a problem because the replacement part is made of metal instead of plastic, and they refuse to do anything about this even under warranty. This is a part that is NEVER supposed to go bad on any cars, this is NOT a wear and tear part. I would like to see them held accountable for their (lack of) actions.",

IF THIS IS NOT DISCOVERED, THE OIL WILL SPREAD TO THE REAR TIRES WHICH WILL CAUSE A TRACTION OR BRAKING HAZARD. CHRYSLER HAS NOT MODIFIED THE HOUSING AND WHEN YOU REPLACE , IT IS REPLACED WITH THE SAME PART THAT WILL FAIL IN THE FUTURE.

Luckily nobody was driving at the time as this could have caused serious injury or death -- imagine if a driver-side airbag went off while driving, prompting a collision with other vehicles and/or pedestrians.  The car had not been driven for approximately 24 hours and had not been in any accidents or had any previous incidents. There were no warning lights previously regarding the airbag or any other issues with the car.  The car has been seen by Lake Norman Jeep Chrysler (and is still there) and they did replace the passenger side airbag per a recall. They do not know the cause of the deployment. The airbag and ORC module need replacement at a cost of $2,200. The dealer said that Jeep would not cover the cost for the repairs because the driver's side airbag is not being recalled and because the car is no longer under warranty. The dealer suggested we contact Chrysler directly via their customer assistance department.   Chrysler Customer Assistance Center (800-247-9753) was not interested in helping us figure this out and in fact, would not let us speak to a manager regarding this situation. They stated that the airbag costs would not be covered as the 2015 Jeep Wranger is no longer under warranty.   We feel it is Jeep's responsibility to fix/pay for this defect and it should also be looked into further to see if there are many others, or if this is a standalone case. Some google searches have said some airbags have been known to explode due to heat/humidity. The temperature at the time of deployment was approximately 75 degrees.  We are most disheartened by the poor response from Chrysler's Customer Assistance Center, and shocked that they would not let us speak to a manager.  Unbelievable lack of concern and service.",

IT WOULD LAST FOR A FEW TO SEVERAL SECONDS AND SLOW DOWN TO A POINT LESS THAN THE STEADY THROTTLE. WHEN I WOULD USE CRUISE CONTROL THE VEHICLE WOULD VARY IN SPEED BY FIVE TO SEVEN MILES PER HOUR.  THIS WAS DEFINITELY A CHANGE FROM THE WAY IT OPERATED PRIOR TO THE RECALL. I USED INJECTOR CLEANER THROUGH SEVERAL TANKS, BUT THE PROBLEM PERSISTED. THE CONDITION WAS LIMITED TO DEPRESSING THE ACCELERATOR, BUT HAS WORSENED TO THE POINT OF REVVING THE ENGINE WITH THE CLUTCH DEPRESSED AND NO PRESSURE ON THE ACCELERATOR.  I HAD TO CUT THE ENGINE OFF DUE TO THIS UNCONTROLLABLE REV.  I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP TO INQUIRY OF ANY SUCH ISSUES FOLLOWING THE AIR BAG RECALL, BUT BEFORE I COULD COMPLETE MY QUESTION, I WAS TOLD, \"NO.\" MAYBE, THIS ISSUE IS COINCIDENCE, BUT IT IS TRULY A SAFETY CONCERN. I HAVE SEARCHED THE NET FOR SIMILAR INCIDENTS, AND IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE VERY PREVALENT.  THE VEHICLE CURRENTLY HAS JUST OVER 68K MILES, AND ZERO INCIDENTS/PROBLEMS PRIOR TO THE AIRBAG RECALL. I BELIEVE THE STEERING WHEEL IS REMOVED WHEN THE AIRBAG ISSUE IS CORRECTED, AND FOR THIS REASON I QUESTION IF THE ISSUES ARE UNINTENTIONALLY RELATED.  *TR",

NOT BEING ABLE TO DRIVE YOUR VEHICLE TO AND FROM WORK IS ALSO A ECONOMICAL BURDEN. I NEED THIS RECALL PERFORMED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WHAT IS BEING DONE ABOUT THIS.

        "summary": "DRIVING ON A FOUR LANE HIGHWAY AROUND 2PM. I HAD BEEN DRIVING FOR A SOLID HOUR ON THE SAME HIGHWAY WHEN MY JEEP SUDDENLY ACCELERATED.  THE GAS PEDAL PROCEEDED TO THE FLOOR EVEN WHILE I TAPPED AND PRESSED PUMPING MY BRAKES. I RECALL AN INITIAL ODD FEELING UNDERFOOT PRIOR TO THE CLIMBING ACCELERATION.  I FELT THE PEDAL PULL AWAY DIRECTLY AFTER I FELT A VIBRATION UNDERFOOT.   I WAS NOT USING CRUISE CONTROL NOR WAS IT ENGAGED .   THE ENGINE WAS CYCLING LOUDLY AND THE RPM GAUGE WAS CLIMBING IN THE RED,  I HAD NO CAR MAT IN PLACE BECAUSE I SPILLED A PROTEIN SHAKE A WEEK EARLIER AND IT STILL SMELLED. I STILL CHECKED VISUALLY TO SEE IF SOMETHING SOMEHOW WAS OBSTRUCTING THE PEDAL.    I HAD MY HANDS ON THE TOP OF THE WHEEL PER USUAL COMFORT SPOTS.  I WAS LIKE, WAIT...WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING??  I HAD TO PRESS AS HARD AS I COULD ON THE BRAKES WHILE PULLING THE EMERGENCY BRAKE UP SLOWLY TO BRING THE OPEN THROTTLED CAR TO A STOP.  I NOTICED JUST BEFORE TURNING OFF THE CAR A RED LIGHTNING BOLT APPEARED ON THE DASHBOARD.  MY NEW CAR WAS 4 WEEKS NEW TO OUR FAMILY.  I AM AN EXPERIENCED DRIVER WHO OWNED JEEPS BEFORE IN 1989.  THE GAS PEDAL WAS SO TIGHTLY PRESSED INTO THE FLOOR I COULD NOT GET THE TIP OF MY SHOE UNDER TO PULL IT UP.  I WAS TAKEN FOR A DEATH RIDE FOR 10 MINUTES.  THE CAR SMELLED LIKE BURNING MOTOR!  IF THERE WAS TRAFFIC THIS DAY I CANNOT THINK OF THE REPERCUSSIONS .",

        "summary": "I RECENTLY PURCHASED A NEW JEEP RUBICON UNLIMITED AND HAD THE DEALER INSTALL A MOPAR 4 INCH FACTORY APPROVED LIFT KIT. THE KIT HAS A LOT OF ISSUES WITH IT AND NOT A WHOLE LOT OF ANSWERS TO FIX THEM. I WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE WITH MY 13 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IN THE PASSENGER SEAT WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL STARTED TO SHAKE UNCONTROLLABLY AND WE HEADED INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC. I WAS ABLE TO GET CONTROL OF THE JEEP ONLY BY SLAMMING ON THE BRAKES AND TURNING AWAY FROM THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC. THE DEALERSHIP HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL WITH TRYING TO ANSWER MY QUESTIONS BUT THEY ARE NOW SAYING THIS IS A MOPAR PARTS ISSUE AND THEY ARE IN A HOLDING PATTERN UNTIL THEY CAN GET SOME ANSWERS.  I CALLED MOPAR AND THEY SAID IT IS THE DEALERS RESPONSIBILITY AND CHRYSLER HAS THE FINAL SAY ABOUT THE REPAIR PROCESS. THE JEEP HAS LESS THAN 800 MILES ON IT AND IM IN A RENTAL MINIVAN. TOO COOL !!!!!!  LIST OF ISSUES :  ALIGNMENT CASTOR CANNOT BE CORRECTED TO FACTORY SPECS DUE TO LACK OF ADJUSTMENT.  FRONT AXLE IS NOT CENTERED DUE TO LACK OF ADJUSTMENT  STEERING DRAG LINK DIGS INTO INSIDE OF WHEEL AND KNOCKS OFF THE BALANCE WEIGHTS.  THE TRACK BAR BRACKET IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH AND HAS BENT ALLOWING THE STABILIZER AND TRACK BAR TO HAVE EXCESSIVE PLAY.    THESE ISSUES ALL DEAL WITH THE STEERING COMPONENTS AND WAS CAUSED BY THE INSTALLATION OF THIS LIFT KIT.",
