This recently occurred on a 70 mph freeway and nearly caused a sideswipe accident with a large semi as I was thrown from my travel lane. The Jeep owners forum (and Fiat Chrysler America) know about this issue with the steering dampener, but neither the NHTSA nor FCA has seen fit to issue a warning or recall. Our Jeep is never taken off-road and is under 60,000 miles. We are the original owners, and the Jeep is currently with the dealer.",

        "summary": "We were exploring some remote mountain roads on Saturday 11/23/2024. The Jeep was running fine and nothing abnormal was observed. We stopped for lunch at an area with a nice view. We made sandwiches and took our time eating. After packing up, we jumped back into the Jeep to continue our journey. I started the Jeep and we immediately smelled fuel. I turned the Jeep off to investigate and found a large amount of fuel on the ground under the rear area of the engine. I had my wife start the Jeep again briefly to see where the gas was coming from. As soon as she started it, an ALARMING volume of fuel began to spray all over the exhaust and turbo. The high pressure fuel line from the gas tank to the high pressure fuel pump on the rear of the motor had ruptured and was dangerously spraying an enormous amount of fuel all over the rear driver side area of the engine bay. We were lucky in that we had stopped for lunch and the exhaust had cooled down and did not ignite the gas. We were unlucky because we were stranded in the backcountry with a vehicle that was inoperable. Fortunately, we were able to get the Jeep off of the mountain and back onto the trailer 5 hours after the incident and before dark.  Had the timing of the failed fuel line been different, I could have been driving down the road or highway with a hot exhaust and the Jeep would have ignited and caught fire very quickly. What is even scarier to me is that I take my two toddlers to day care every day in this Jeep. Had a vehicle fire ignited with the amount of fuel that was spraying (and would have continued to spray if the Jeep was left on) would have engulfed the Jeep very quickly. Who knows if I would have been able to get both kids out of their car seats in time to save them. This is very dangerous! I know there have been many Jeep JLs that have caught fire. I have an example of the failure that is likely causing these fires! The part is available for inspection.",

Everything from ABS, shifter lock, sway bar, airbags, traction control, aux battery and some other things that i can't remember. Engine lost power, power steering and unable to shift out of park. I took to my local dealer, I didn't buy it from them, and they diagnsoed the issue of a faulty ABS module. This module has been in the stage of \"engineering\" for over a year.  I spent $900 on one ABS module that was available out of 5 in the US from another dealer and to get 20 minutes down the road only to have it happen again. The vehicle was at the dealer for 5 weeks. The new part was to become available on May20th. Two days ago the service manager called to tell me that they pushed the date to Aug 20th. This will be almost 2 years in this process with this part. The manager then proceeded to tell me it will probably be longer as Jeep went to a new vendor and it is redoing the part. I know of hundreds of other owners in the same boat. Jeep star techs say they can't diagnose past this part so I am paying on a big paper weight since November 23. I have started a case with Jeep customer care only for them to say they can't do anything financially or anything other than help expedite the issue. This is a lost cause as it is still being developed 2 years later. My GM of the dealership said he has 4-5 others at his lot in the same boat and a number of other owners with vehicles like myself at the house. I feel the need for someone to put pressure on the vendor to help with getting a recall on this situation.",

Wouldn\u2019t do damper  replacement without tie rod fix though.  Didn\u2019t have damper and would take 5 days to get in (1 day for tie rod part), but when I stated I wanted to repair it they miraculously came up with all the parts and had it finished before tie rod part even showed up. My complaint is that the original FCA lawsuit where they replaced damper was a bandaid for the real problem which is the tie rods.  I paid the $2500 but will be pushing this up the chain of command.   I know the lawsuit alluded to the damper not being the root of the problem but a cheaper fix for Jeep.

It continues to hang due to the defect and is obstructing vision of the windshield for safe driving.  The vehicle is available for inspection if requested. This is a safety hazard and an obvious defect with the part mounting the visor to the vehicle.   I called the dealership and they confirmed this was a known issue with newer Jeep Wranglers and that the entire visor could be replaced for several hundred dollars at my expense.  The visor itself is not the issue, it is how it is secured to the vehicle that is the problem. It appears as though it has detached itself from whatever was securing it safely to the vehicle. There were no warning signs or any issue with the visor prior to it releasing itself and swinging freely causing distraction to driving and possibly bodily injury.  When spoken to, the dealership confirmed this is a known issue with the way the newer visors are designed in new Jeep Wranglers.  Upon conducting online research, this issue is common and others are experiencing it as well.  In a potential accident or general driving this visor could detach itself and be propelled possibly injuring the driver and passengers.  This safety related defect needs to be recalled and fixed immediately and not at the owners expense.",

        "summary": "We started experiencing a problem with our clutch on our manual transmission 2019 Jeep Wrangler Sport in December 2022. It felt like it would slip out of gear on its own, sounded like when someone first learns how to drive a manual and grinds the clutch. The dealer couldn't figure it out. Kept getting worse. Multiple trips back to the dealer. Mind you at the time this car was 3 1/2 years old and only had about 40,000 miles. Finally we found out there was a recall in February 2023, and the dealer told us there were no parts or no solution yet. This car is my wife's daily driver. I called the dealer back a couple months later, no update yet, Jeep \"was working on it\", hoped remedy would be available by end of June. Kept calling back every month or two, same story. I drove the car for the first time in a while in July and realized it was not safe to drive. Constantly slipping out of gear, couldn't get it going fast enough. Decided to read the recall again and realized it said it was a fire hazard. My dealer called and was told still no remedy, now they tell him hopefully end of Q3, so I asked the service manager to please get me into a loaner on Jeep. They did this. This is almost 2 months later, still no remedy. It's fantastic how Jeep can spend millions on fancy advertisements with Derek Jeter, yet because the people who own clutch vehicles are such a small percentage it seems our safety is not a priority. I can't believe a major car manufacturer has taken over 7 months knowing there is a safety issue and still no remedy.",

A week and a half ago around Aug. 23, 2023 my jeep started smelling hot while driving and there is a rattle between 3rd and 4th gear.  My jeep is a manual transmission.  I took it to LaFontaine Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram of Clinton, 1111 W Michigan Ave, Clinton, MI 49236; [XXX] .  They told me it would be $1100 to just look at my Jeep and diagnose it, after confirming it was the clutch that is the problem.  They proceeded to tell me it would be $3600 to repair the clutch.  They never told me there was an open recall on my Jeep.  I remembered getting the letter in the mail from Mopar so I found it.  The recall was indeed for the clutch.  The dealership never even mentioned the recall.  They just wanted me to pay for the clutch.  I called them back and asked them why they didn't tell me about the recall. They told me that it wasn't a \"real\" recall yet.  I told them I looked it up on their website and it said it was.  He told me since there is no remedy I just have to pay to have it fixed.  He offered no other alternative so I am without a vehicle.  I called Mopar to try to complain but they said they have nothing to do with dealerships but gave me a case number # [XXX] and said they had no idea when the remedy would be available and that there was nothing they could do.  I told them I was without a vehicle and they told me to take my Jeep to another dealership.  I asked them if that would change the outcome and they said no but maybe they would say it wasn't the clutch.  I am already out $300 from having this dealership. Please help me.

        "summary": "I purchased this new 2019 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited in late December of 2019. Approximately two years into ownership, rust began to appear along the frame welds. Roughly 2.75 years into ownership, this corrosion began to become very noticeable throughout the frame welds located underneath the vehicle. Many welds also feature small holes. In September of 2022 (33 months into ownership), I began to investigate the issue. I spoke with a local dealership and Jeep Customer Care via email, phone and in-person (I can produce the correspondence if needed). I was told by the dealership that I had 25 months left on corrosion warranty, but that it did not cover corrosion to the frame or suspension. I was also told that the holes are not an issue. I also contacted Jeep Customer Care several times (with photos) and received very little assistance. Jeep Customer Care also stated 25 months left on corrosion warranty, but that a dealership must diagnosis and state that it is a covered issue. Jeep refuses to further address the issue until the dealership does. The dealership has stated they will not, no matter how much I mention this appears to be a significant (and unsafe) defect. The dealership has since stopped communicating. A local body shop (unaffiliated with Jeep), upon inspecting the vehicle, stated that this Jeep should not be in this state of disrepair so early into its life. This vehicle does not feel safe given the severity and location of the corrosion/deterioration throughout the frame and suspension.",

There is another FOX SHOX product available that will solve this problem but it is a more expensive part.  There are also other suppliers that can provide an acceptable part.

        "summary": "About 2-2.5 months ago, our 2019 Jeep Wrangler completely stalled out at a stop light.  At the time it stalled, the dash started flashing and gave me many warning lights.  I was unable to put the transmission in park in order to try to start the vehicle again.  After many attempts, I was finally able to place in park and start the vehicle.  I then went thru a drive thru and it did the same thing and left me stranded in the drive thru lane without being able to start it for about 10 minutes.  The next day, I was on my way to work and while traveling on the highway at 75 miles per hour, the vehicle stalled out, the dash wigged out and I lost all control of the vehicle including steering.  The engine revved up to a higher RPM and I was unable to put it in neutral to try to slow it down and control the vehicle to a safe stop on the side of the highway.  There were a couple of close calls with other vehicles due to the inability to control the steering or the engine speed.  The next day, I took the Jeep to the dealership and when scanned for codes, there was over 150 codes including losing communication with the Body Control Module.  Dealership test drove and the tech had the vehicle replicate the issues and leave him stranded 7 times in one day from and back to the shop.    At this time, my concern is the safety of my family.  For now it appears that the issue has been resolved, but there have been many similar instances reported with the same danger of crashing.  Paperwork obtained from my dealership reflects there was a module that was replaced when the vehicle had less than 8,000 miles that was supposed to fix this issue, however it occurred to our jeep that had less than 25,000 miles on it.  The paperwork also states \"!!Attention!! This vehicle may have had 7 visits, 69 days down and 8 repeat repairs, service personnel should notify dealership service management and engage FCA service and parts resources.\"  Doesn't this fall under the Lemon Law?",

I had two other cars pull over because they saw my car of fire. They yelled at me to get out of my car and then quickly checked everything and found the fire had put itself out. I had my 6 year old nephew in the car and I was worried about his safety if the car was on fire but also the safety of having his outside of the car on a major highway. We determined the car wasn\u2019t at a full engulfed in flames risk so I kept him in the car. I then towed my car to the dealership who misdiagnosed it so I towed it to a clutch shop when showed me there were actually two holes through my transmission. My warranty wouldn\u2019t cover it and the recall refused it because they had \u201cdon\u2019t the recall\u201d aka looked at it and did a software update and said that\u2019s all the were required to do. I ended up finding a used transmission and was able to get that installed as well as a clutch.

Will be taking it in to dealership for inspection.  As I have researched...this appears to be another case of the \"death wobble\".",

The screws would not budge to remove the seatbelt, I had 3 people I had to ask for help as the seatbelt was getting tighter and tighter and cutting off circulation to my son. We finally had to cut him out. I reported this right away to the dealer. My service advisor kept putting me off stating the seatbelt was backordered. We made due with the remaining seatbelts. 7 months later the middle seatbelt quit retracting. I was left with just one working seatbelt in the back seat, with 2 young boys, now 10 and 12, and I cannot drive anyone else in my car as I do not have working seatbelts. I have gone into my dealer, sent several emails to my Jeep dealer and spoke in person and in email to the manager and have been ignored. I sent in my issue to Jeep corporation/Mopar, and they keep giving me the run around and told me i  have to go through the dealer. I have pictures and emails of this all and have been ignored. My lease is up next month, and I have not been able to enjoy my jeep with others for safety reasons. I don't understand. Why i have been ignored and Jeep does not care. There is an issue with the seatbelts in this car.",

Some report it periodically fails while many report the same as me, hard failure.  This screen is an integral part of the vehicle info and safety.  I cannot tell you how much fuel I have.  I cannot easily glance down and quickly see my speed.  I still have a speedo on my model, but it isn\u2019t as easy to read as the large digital display.  I have to really divert my gaze to obtain the speed.  I recently ran out of gas on the highway with no fuel gauge.   Why would a screen wear out? Why should a digital screen wearing out be acceptable? This is not right.   This generation of Jeeps has been plagued with issues.

The front track bar was replaced and an alignment was needed again at 12,000 miles. I first noticed the car going out of alignment before this all happened, then the wobble followed at higher speeds. It was a very scary experience all five times. I read about it and found that the last few times when i hit a small bump it would activate the wobble until i slowed down.

Sometimes a complete stop in the travel lane of a highway is necessary.  The vehicle was purchased used with 18K miles.  After 5K miles a vibration was felt at the front wheels anytime driving over bridge or overpass.  At 30K miles the vibration/bounce occasionally required emergency braking.  The closest dealer was booked during the Holidays and it was over 30 days for an appointment.  During the appointment was told it was the steering dampener, a \"known issue\" but, the parts are on backorder, no ETA provided.

At speeds between 60-75 mph on highway roads that have small bumps and or divots, the front axle begins a divergent shudder and wobble side to side that is uncontrollable. It has happened now 7 times. In traffic I have almost caused accidents because the vehicle is not controllable with the steering wheel. At highway speeds, the only way to make the divergent wobble decrease and go away is to immediately step on the brakes in an emergency mode, hope you don't get rear ended and pull off the road. The vehicle has been inspected in detail by two different organizations. I have had the alignment checked, it's perfect. Shocks are perfect. Everything is fine, accept, when the perfect harmonic is reached on a bump at highway speeds, the front axle goes ballistic and makes the vehicle uncontrollable. This is a safety issue that has/will kill people. There are no warning lamps or caution lights. The vehicle is in perfect condition.",

I have taken it to two jeep dealerships and was told that it can be due to the suspension or differential. I have not drove this jeep on rough terrain or 4 by 4. The dealership is looking into the suspension system for the death wobble problem. The jeep currently stands at 40,000 miles. I also have a warning lamp that shows to service the axle locker system. According to the dealer, the axle locker system is an electrical issue and not a mechanical one. I wanted to report this problem as it is a safety issue and it is dangerous to drive in this condition.",

Some of the main ones I was able to see in the instrument cluster were \"Service Shifter\", \"Service Antilock Break System\", \"Service 4WD\", \"Traction control Failure\" and \"Emergency Break\" light on when E-Break was not engaged. Four (4) Months later and over 10 back and forth visits to the dealership, the problem still persists after being told \"we test drove it 50+ miles and we see no problem\". They have since replaced three (3) Body Control Modules. Why am I writing this report? Because in the situation when those warning lamps turn on and I am actively driving the vehicle, I've experienced the following concerns: 1.) Stopped at a stop light and the engine shut off. Then it takes a few frantic tries to turn the vehicle back on - this happened twice. 2.) Drove on the highway when the gears stopped shifting causing the engine to rev incredibly fast - this happened once. 3.) Increased resistance from steering wheel while steering while on highway speeds. 4.) Gear shifter locks - happens often, but typically only when I initially turn on the vehicle; Doesn't allow to move the shifter out of Park. As you'll see by my answers on the form, my vehicle has low miles and is kept in prestine condition.",

Driving down the road has aways been a bit like playing \"ping pong\" with the steering as you have to make slight steering corrections as the Jeep drifts left or right towards the lane lines.  I recently lifted the jeep and put on slightly larger tires. This made the wandering and \"ping pong\" steering control a lot worse.  I had the shop make some adjustments and they basically got everything back to where it was before - still playing ping pong as I drive, but now when I take an exit ramp, the traction control light will come on.  There is a Jeep technical service bulletin out for this issue. As long as the lift is within specs, changing out the steering box and flashing the software apparently fixes the problem.  How can excessive play in steering NOT BE A SAFETY ISSUE?  How many accidents must there be, or God forbid, a death on the road, before the manufacturer has to fix this? The dealer wants to charge me $1400 to correct this issue, which they created my failing to design and manufacture a steering box that works properly with their vehicle. If I wanted to fix this myself and install the new steering box, I would have to buy a $10,000 software flash system if I want to make sure all the warning lights correlate to the actual driving characteristics of the vehicle.

I notice while seaching the internet for aftermarket steering fixes that Jeep had a TSB for the exact same issue I have and others who were still under warranty were getting the new sterring components and loving their Jeep!  I am still frustrated that the dealer says its no longer covered for me even though all the new models have the new steering components now.

This is similar to Jeep's TSB 23-020-19 - \"Front Seat Will Not Unfold and Lock Into Position / June 20, 2019\".  However the dealer tells me that the problem is not the same as the TSB and the seat frame needs to be replaced.   This is the second time we have experienced this failure. The previous time I was able to return the seat to the normal position after much difficulty. In that case I was able to drive the vehicle to the dealer for repair.

WRANGLER STYLE JEEPS ARE KNOWN FOR CATCHING THE WIND HOWEVER, WITH THE WANDERING PROBLEM IN THE STEERING YOU TEND TO OVERSTEER TO COMPENSATE MAKING THE VEHICLE VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL.

IF YOU GO ON LINE AND PUNCH IN JEEP WANDERING ISSUES THERE ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF POST ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND IT APPEARS THAT JEEP JUST IGNORES THIS SAFETY ISSUE. I WOULDN'T BE TAKING THE TIME TO WRITE THIS IF IT WERE JUST AN INCONVENIENCE. THIS IS A SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS PROBLEM. MY WIFE HAS A 2019 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE AND IT RIDES LIKE A LUXURY CAR. SHE WON;T EVEN DRIVE MY RUBICON BECAUSE  SHE IS SO SCARED OF HOW IT WANDERS. THE STEERING WHEEL HAS TO BE CONSTANTLY COMPENSATED BACK AND FORTH TO KEEP IT IN LINE.

SPEEDS OF 50 MPH OR LESS DO NOT SEEM TO TRIGGER THE SHAKING, BUT IT OCCURS INTERMITTENTLY AT SPEEDS OVER 50 MPH. AS LONG AS I AM IN THE SLOW LANE WITH ROOM TO EXIT THE ROAD, IT IS SAFE TO DRIVE. HOWEVER, IT IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE IF THERE IS NO WAY TO EXIT THE ROADWAY WHEN IT OCCURS AS THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE SHAKING IS TO COME TO A COMPLETE STOP.",

BEING A FIRST TIME JEEP OWNER, INITIALLY I THOUGHT MAYBE THAT WAS JUST THE WAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DRIVE.  AFTER A FEW MONTHS, IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT TO ME THAT A BRAND NEW JEEP COULD BE THIS SLOPPY IN THE STEERING.  THERE IS A TON OF PLAY IN THE STEERING WHEEL WHICH MEANS CONSTANTLY OVER-CORRECTING TO STAY IN A LANE. IT IS NOTICEABLE AT ALL SPEEDS BUT EVEN MORE SO AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. I FIND THAT I CANNOT TAKE ONE HAND OFF THE WHEEL AT ANYTIME WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY BECAUSE IT CAN WANDER. THIS IS AN EXHAUSTING WAY TO DRIVE NOT TO MENTION THE CONSTANT BUMP STEER THAT HAPPENS WHEN GOING OVER ANY MINOR BUMP OR HIGHWAY OVERPASS.  IT'S NERVE WRACKING DRIVING IN TIGHT LANES ON THE HIGHWAY AND ESPECIALLY IN CONSTRUCTION ZONES. IT'S TO THE POINT THAT I HONESTLY DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING IT AND NEITHER DOES MY BOYFRIEND.    I HAVE BROUGHT THIS UP NOW AT TWO DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS FOR A TOTAL OF 5-6 TIMES.  THE MOST RECENT RESPONSE WAS, \"THAT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THE BEAST\". I'M SORRY BUT THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.  THE FIRST DEALERSHIP PUT MY DAMPER RECALL PART IN UPSIDE DOWN AND SO I DROVE ON AN UPSIDE DOWN PART FOR 5 MONTHS BEFORE I EXPERIENCED THE DEATH WOBBLE ON THE HIGHWAY.
