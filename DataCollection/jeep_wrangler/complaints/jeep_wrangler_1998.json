In 2010, 3 or the 4 rear axle control arms broke free from the frame causing brake lines to fail while driving. I was able to use parking brake and downshifting manual transmission to get home. I was lucky that the rear axle didn't completely separate or the failed brake cause a serious accident. The TJ frames are poorly designed with no drainage causing them to rust from the inside out.",

THE PART WHERE THE FRAME MOUNTS TO THE BODY IS ACTUALLY MISSING ONE DUE TO RUSTING COMPLETELY OUT. EVERY SINGLE BOLT AND NUT IS RUSTED. EVERY SINGLE SQUARE INCH OF THE FRAME IS RUSTED.

IS CHRYSLER WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO GET KILLED IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE?  BIG CORPORATIONS AND POLITICS MEET TO SCREW THE GENERAL PUBLIC ONCE AGAIN?  CHRYSLER, TAKE A LESSON FROM TOYOTA AND FIX THESE FRAMES BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED GOING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AT 65 MPH AND THEIR FRAME BREAKS.  MY JEEP WAS TOTALLY BONE STOCK WHEN THIS WAS DISCOVERED.  I'M NOT TRYING TO GET A DOLLAR BACK FOR WHAT I PAID, JUST TRYING TO BRING AWARENESS TO THIS AS HAVE MANY OTHERS.  JEEPERS LOVER THEIR JEEPS NO DOUBT AND ARE VERY LOYAL TO THE BRAND.

I HAD RECENTLY TAKEN IT TO A FABRICATION SHOP TO SEE IF IT COULD BE REPAIRED, AND AFTER EXAMINATION THE SHOP OWNER SAID THERE IS NO SOLID METAL LEFT IN THE FRAME FOR A REPAIR TO BE POSSIBLE. HE SAID THERE ARE NO DRAIN HOLES ON BOTTOM OF THE JEEP FRAME, BUT ONLY HOLES THAT THE MANUFACTURER PUT ON THE SIDE OF THE FRAME. HE SAID, AS A RESULT ROAD GRIME ENTERED THE FRAME FROM THESE MANUFACTURED SIDE HOLES, GOT TRAPPED INSIDE THE FRAME AND CAUSED IT TO RUST FROM THE INSIDE OUT. HE SAID THAT IS WHY I HAD NOT DETECTED THE SEVERITY OF THE RUST PROBLEM BEFORE NOW. THE SHOP OWNER PUT HIS HAND INSIDE THE FRAME AND PULLED OUT A HANDFUL OF MOIST ROAD GRIME AND LOOSE RUST FLAKES TO FURTHER ILLUSTRATE THE PROBLEM. THE SHOP OWNER WENT ON TO INFORM ME THAT MY JEEP IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE. IN STARK CONTRAST, THE UNDERSIDE OF THE BODY OF THE JEEP HAS ABSOLUTELY NO RUST AT ALL.  *TR",

THE WRANGLER IS TOTALED AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY WILL NOT PAY THE VEHICLE OFF.  WE ARE SHORT $3,000 OF THE PAY OFF.  MY IMMEDIATE CONCERN IS  I WAS GLAD I WAS NOT DRIVING AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE AND DID THIS HAPPEN TO OTHER OWNERS OF A WRANGLER.  THIS CAR IS ONLY GOING INTO 5 YEARS OLD AND HAS HAD THE REAR END REPLACED AT OUR EXPENSE AND THE GAUGES GO ON AND OFF AND THIS WAS FIXED ONCE. WHAT CAUSED THIS ELECTRICAL FIRE?  I WANT JEEP TO RESPOND TO WHY THIS HAPPENED.    *TT",

        "summary": "I HAVE HAD NUMEROUS PROBLEMS WITH MY JEEP WRANGLER 1998.  THIS IS A PARTIAL LIST I SENT TO CHRYSLER:  I BOUGHT MY JEEP WITH JUST 3600 MILES ON IT FROM A DEALER IN 1999. FROM DAY ONE I STARTED EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS. MANY OF THEM I RETURNED TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT. SOME THEY WERE ABLE TO FIX, OTHERS, AFTER MANY RETURN TRIPS, THEY WERE 'UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM'. 1.  GAUGES WOULD STOP WORKING WHILE DRIVING - I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN 5 TIMES BEFORE THEY WERE ABLE TO DUPLICATE AND FINALLY FIX THE PROBLEM. 2.  THIS WAS ALSO TRUE OF THE BLINKERS THAT NOT ALWAYS WORKED - OR WORKED ALL AT THE SAME TIME.  3.   MY HAZARDS STILL DO NOT WORK EVERY TIME. 4. THE AIR CONDITIONER GOES OUT WHEN DRIVING,VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN IT IS HOT AND RAINING. 5. THE SOUND BAR HAS NEVER WORKED PROPERLY - FIRST IT WOULD ONLY COME IN SOME TIMES - NOW NEVER.  6.  HEADERS ARE CRACKED - BAD. THEY HAVE BEEN WELDED SEVERAL TIMES. WHEN I WENT TO HAVE THEM WELDED IT WAS FOUND THEY WERE WELDED BEFORE MY PURCHASE - AT 3600 MIL!  THEY ARE STILL CRACKED, WELDING DOES NOT HOLD. I CAN NOT GET ANYONE TO REPLACE THEM BECAUSE EVEN EXHAUST SPECIALISTS SAY IT IS TOO CUMBERSOME. THE DEALER CHARGES WAY MORE THAN I HAVE CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF REPAIRS AND THE PRICE OF GAS - AT 12 MPG.  7.  DRIVERS SEAT BELT LOCKS TIGHTLY WITH ANY AMOUNT OF PRESSURE ON THE BRAKES - IT HAS NOW GOTTEN TO THE POINT IT LOCKS JUST WHILE DRIVING.  8.  WINDOWS - THE ZIPPERS BROKE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY - I PAID ALOT TO HAVE THESE REPLACED. THE BACK WINDOW NOW HAS A CUT IN IT AND IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE THROUGH. 9.  THE TOP HAS NEVER QUITE FIT RIGHT; IT HAS ALWAYS LEAKED AND BEEN EXTREMELY NOISY - MORE SO THAN ANYONE ELSE'S THAT I KNOW. IT HAS ALSO COME APART AT THE SEAMS.  THE DEALERSHIP HAS NOT BEEN OF ANY HELP. THEY WANTED TO CHARGE OUTRAGEOUS AMOUNTS JUST FOR DIAGNOSTICS, EVEN WHEN I HAD THE BEST WARRANTY. I'VE ALSO HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE DOOR MOLDING COMING OUT IMMEDIATELY, GRINDING IN THE STEERING WHEEL, GRINDING WHILE TRYING TO PUT IT IN REVERSE AND MORE.    *NLM",

I DON'T BELIEVE THEY FIXED IT, JUST TIGHTENED THE LINKAGE UP. MY WIFE AND I SPENT 7 HOURS AT LANDERS WITHOUT ANYONE CONTACTING US ABOUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. THEY ALSO BROKE A BOLT OFF IN THE BLOCK THAT HOLDS THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD ON, AGAIN WE WEREN'T INFORMED. OUR WARRENTY COVERED THE EXHAUST PROBLEM, BUT LANDERS SAID THAT THE LINKAGE WASN'T COVERED EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD WORKED ON THE LINKAGE LESS THAN A YEAR AGO. THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO COVER ANY REPAIRS THEY MAKE FOR A YEAR, BUT THEY DIDN'T HONOR THIS. WE SPENT 7 HOURS WAITING FOR THE JEEP TO BE REPAIRED. THEY OFFERED US A RENTAL TO GET US HOME, BUT DIDN'T OFFER ANY GAS MONEY OR  ANYTHING FOR OUR INCOVIENCE ABOUT DRIVING 150 MILES (ONE WAY).  I'M A GUNSMITH  AND MAKE $30 A HOUR AND I WAS AWAY FROM MY WORK FOR 20 HOURS BECAUSE OF LANDERS NOT INFORMING ME OF HOW LONG THE REPAIRS WOULD TAKE. NOW I'M BEHIND WITH MY WORK AND HAVING TO WORK16 HOURS A DAY TO CATCH UP. I WOULD LIKE SOME COMP. FOR MY TIME LOST. ALSO MY WIFE WENT WITH ME TO LANDERS AND SAT THROUGH THEIR LIES, AND SHE LOST WORK TIME ALSO. LANDERS IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A FIVE STAR RATING TOWARD THEIR CUSTOMERS. WE WERE TREATED LIKE UNWANTED STEP-CHILDREN. LANDERS DIDN'T OFFER TO SUPPLY US WITH TRANSPORT TO GO GET SOMETHING TO EAT, INFORM US OF THE PROBLEMS WITH OUR JEEP, AND CHARGED US 69.97 FOR LABOR AND 24.97 FOR PARTS, THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE WORN OUT AFTER 27,100 MILES UNLESS THEY DAMAGED WHEN THEY 'FIXED' THE LINKAGES THE FIRST TIME. I KNOW I'M NOT IMPROTANT TO THEM, BUT I BELIEVE THEY DESTROYED THE BUSHINGS THE FIRST TIME THEY WORKED ON THEM, AND BROKE THE MANIFOLD BOLT TRYING TO TIGHTEN IT DOWN CAUSING THEM TO HAVE TO PULL THE HEAD OFF THE MOTOR  HEAD OFF THE ENGINE TO GET TO.*AK",

I FILLED THE FUEL TANK ON A 1998 JEEP WRANGLER ON A SUNDAY NIGHT, THE VEHICLE SAT IN MY DRIVEWAY OVER NIGHT AND INTO THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON.  UPON RETURNING HOME FROM WORK I NOTICED A VERY STRONG ODOR OF GASOLINE, UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION I FOUND THE FUEL RUNNING AT A STEAY STREAM ONTO MY DRIVEWAY FROM THE JEEP I HAD FILLED UP THE PREVIOUS EVENING.  I ATTEMPTED TO LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK AND STOP IT, HOWEVER I WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.  I REMOVED THE FUEL TANK FROM THE VEHICLE AND FOUND THE FUEL TO BE LEAKING AROUND THE RETAINING RING FOR THE FUEL PUMP THAT IS INSTALLED IN THE FUEL TANK.  I CHECKED THE SCREW ON RETAINING RING FOR TIGHTNESS AND FOUND IT TO BE SECURE AND SNUG ON THE TANK.  THE RING IS A SCREW ON TYPE COLLAR MADE OF HARDENED PLASTIC, WHICH HOLDS THE FUEL PUMP IN THE TANK, THE FUEL PUMP SITS ON A FLAT RUBBER GASKET WHICH SITS ON THE LIP OF THE PLASTIC GAS TANK.  UPON REMOVING THE RETAINING RING AND LIFTING THE FUEL PUMP OUT OF THE TANK I NOTICED THE GASKET WAS CRIMPED AND TORN ON THE TOP FLAT PORTION OF THE GASKET.   I CONTACTED THE OWNER TO DISCUSS POSSIBLE CAUSES FOR THE GASKET TEAR, THE OWNER CLAIMED TO HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE IN FOR A FAULTY FUEL LEVEL INDICATOR A COUPLE MONTHS EARLIER.  WHICH WAS INLINE WITH WHAT I HAD ASSUMED SEEING AS THE FUEL TANK HAD GREASE PENCIL WRITING ON TOP OF THE TANK INDICATING A TECHNICIANS INITIALS, DATE AND MILEAGE.   THIS PROBABLY EXPLAINS THE TORN GASKET, HOWEVER UPON OBTAINING A NEW GASKET AND ATTEMPTING TO REINSTALL THE NEW GASKET IN THE TANK WITH THE FUEL PUMP I NOTICED THE REASON THE GASKET PROBABLY TORE, THE RETAINING RING HAS A TENDENCY TO GRAB THE GASKET AND TURN IT AS THE RING SEATS ITSELF.
