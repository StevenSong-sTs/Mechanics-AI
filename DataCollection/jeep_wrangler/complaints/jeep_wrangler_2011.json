Tried to restart and nothing happened.  Called AAA and they said I needed a new battery and told me my alternator was in the danger mode.   Took my jeep to a car repair service and told me they had to replace the alternator, but that this a common problem with my year jeep and it still won't be fixed and battery will still die again because the powertrain control module needs to be replaced.  Gave me documents that show the number of jeeps brought into their service center with the same problem. Can't get into a jeep dealership for service until August 29, 2 2024. 4. The engine light has been on for a long time but everyone told me it wasn't anything to worry about, a electronic issue.

Two service stations attempted to fix this without success. The error code is P0455 for an emissions leak. The most recent service station ordered several previously-owned Jeep gas tanks but they all had this same failure. They next ordered a new gas tank from Jeep which was out of stock for several months, indicating they can not keep up with the demand for these failing nipples. When the new gas tank finally came in, this same nipple was broken and this was a brand new gas tank. If you go on line, you will see this is a common problem and a safety issue. As a former engineer for Ford Motor Company, it is clear Jeep has a design flaw that will break and cause a safety risk to customers. The material is wrong for this application, and there is not enough strain relief where this nipple is located. It will inevitably break on all Jeeps at some point in time causing this safety risk. I told the service station that there is no reason to replace the gas tank because this nipple will simply fail again.

        "summary": "In 2013 and 2014 my wife complained of the jeep having the \"death wobble\" on several occasions when she  hit a bump on the highway at speeds of 40 MPH or higher.  She would slow down to less than 10 mph for the wobbling to stop.  The dealership attempted to determine what the issue was but was not able to find anything wrong.  We had the same issue with our 2008 wrangler, and after paying over two thousand dollars in vain attempts to have the problem resolved, and a couple of issues caused by poor workmanship by the dealer, we traded that car in for the 2011 model. My wife seldom drove the jeep for the next few years due to terminal illness.  I started driving it regularly in 2020 and found that the same condition was still occurring.  While it does not happen every time I hit a bump at speeds above 40mph. it is occurring more often and more intensely.  As a result of the intensity of the vibrations, I no longer will drive the jeep above 40 mph.  It is my opinion that since this issue has been a problem for several models of jeeps over the past few years, it should be repaired by Chrysler/Jeep at no cost to the owners.  This sudden vibration has probably caused accidents especially when  one has to slow down suddenly, and should be considered a safety hazard.This has been happening with this jeep since at least March of 2014.",

        "summary": "There is a well known design flaw with the Jeep Wrangler JK parking brake.  The parking brake handle is comprised of two springs, a clutch spring and a clock-spring, which keep tension on the parking brake lines.  When this spring system fails, which it commonly does, the parking brake handle can be pulled all the way to the top without engaging the parking brake and holding the vehicle.  The clutch spring has a extended tail which is supposed to be retained behind a small piece of upright stamped metal, the stop, in order to maintain tension on the spring, which enables proper operation of the parking brake lever.  However, the piece of stamped metal is so small and inefficient, that the clutch spring tail flips past the stop, and the spring loses all tension, and in turn, the parking brake doesn't work.  There are numerous YouTube videos of this well-known design flaw, with various questionable home remedies.  Jeep needs to create a safe fix for this issue to ensure a properly working parking brake, which is especially essential for manual shift vehicles such as mine.  The photo attached shows the temporary home fix I created with a washer to get the clutch spring tail to remain in the proper position behind the stop.",

I request proof that recalled have been done by Jeep and was told we have no open recalls but they are unable to prove they even looked at the truck.   What is frightening is the airbag light and seat belt light have come on and we have checked there is no record of any recalls being done. The truck was built on the day, date, location of where the recalls are from in the same building time.   This seems shady that not myself or out dealer can acquire proof these this have been done. I think it is very conserving that a car company can claim a recall and decide that only 5,300 of 10,000 Jeeps made do not apply to a recall.   Then let\u2019s add a manufacturer can not prove any recalls have been done at all and I have a full history report never one mention but yet there are no recalls. This is dangerous as an airbag can be a a  Grenade if it deploys. I think this is something that should not be hidden from consumers and manufacturers should have to supply this information of proof.   Also we should know why only 1 car is not recalled while every other one is recalled. I would like your involvement is getting our family recall information.

I instructed my passenger to immediately exit the vehicle.  I had bottles of drinking water with us (hot day in Texas) so I took three or four bottles of water and extinguished the flames from both sides of the upper engine.  The flames were immediately extinguished indicating no presence of petroleum products fueling the flames.

CHRYSLER WILL COME BACK AND PROBABLY REPLACE THE ENGINE FOR FREE THIS TIME.    3. WHILE MY CAR HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP THIS WEEKEND , IT WAS BROKEN INTO. BOTH WINDOWS BROKEN AND SPEAKERS STOLEN. THE DEALERSHIP SAID THEY WOULD PAY FOR THIS AND FIX IT.    WHAT I WANT IS NOT A NEW ENGINE. I WANT MY MONEY BACK FOR THE ENTIRE JEEP SINCE THEY SOLD ME A CAR THAT HAS HAD TWO BLOWN ENGINES NOW AND I HAVE ALL THE RECIEPTS TO PROVE THE FIRST TIME I WAS NOT AT FAULT. I DO NOT WANT TO TAKE CHRYSLER TO SMALL CLAIMS. I WANT IT DONE FOR ME. I CANNOT GET TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE AT CHRYSLER IN ORDER TO PUSH THIS FURTHER.    I SPOKE TO A FEW LAWYERS AND THEY SAID IT ISNT NECCESARILY A LEMON LAW CASE BUT IT IS MORE OF A DEALERSHIP/CHRYSLER WARRANTY CASE.    WHAT CAN I DO?    THANK YOU.

SINCE BEING PURCHASED THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS HAVE FAILED INTERMITTENTLY. EACH PART SIMPLY STOPPED WORKING WHILE I WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE AND IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM START WORKING AGAIN I WOULD HAVE TO PULL OVER TURN THE CAR OFF WAIT A FEW MINUTES THEN TURN THE CAR BACK ON (HORN, LIGHTS, WINDOW MASER SWITCH, CAR STEREO, CAR STEREO AMP, DRIVER'S AIRBAG).  ONCE I RESTARTED THE CAR IT SEEMED LIKE THE JEEP WOULD RESET AND THE PARTS WOULD START WORKING AGAIN. JEEP HAS BEEN REPLACING THESE ITEMS, BUT THEY WOULD NEVER ROOT CAUSE THE PROBLEM.   -   MOST RECENTLY CHRYSLER DISCOVERED THAT THE FUSE BOX & ELECTRICAL CLUSTER WERE DEFECTIVE. IT TOOK JEEP 77 DAYS TO REPLACE THE 2 PARTS. THE WORSE PART IS THEY TRIED TO HAVE ME DRIVE THE VEHICLE DURING THOSE 77 DAYS UNTIL THE PARTS BECAME AVAILABLE PUTTING ME AND ANY VEHICLE AROUND ME AT RISK OF INJURY AND DEATH. THIS IN MY OPINION IS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD.  -   WHILE I HOPE THIS IS THE END OF MY PROBLEMS..

I MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR SERVICE - TOOK THE VEHICLE IN - AND RENTED A CAR FOR WHAT I EXPECTED TO BE SEVERAL DAYS OF SERVICE. THAT WAS ABOUT A MONTH AGO. SUBSEQUENTLY, I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE REPAIRS TO THE TOP END OF THE ENGINE DID NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM AND THAT THE ENTIRE ENGINE WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED. THE DEALER APPARENTLY ORDERED A \"LONG BLOCK\" REPLACEMENT ENGINE FROM CHRYSLER, BUT HAS BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS OBTAINING OTHER PARTS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE REPAIR.

HOWEVER, I ALSO CAME ACROSS AN ARTICLE IN \"AUTOWEEK\" DETAILING PROBLEMS CHRYSLER WAS EXPERIENCING WITH JEEP ENGINES OF MY CAR'S VINTAGE - AND THAT THE ENGINE REPLACEMENTS WERE BEING EXACERBATED BY FAILURES IN CHRYLSER'S PARTS SUPPLY CHAIN.

IN THE MEANTIME I WAIT CARLESS...THANK GOODNESS MY 2 CHILDREN WERE NOT IN THE CAR WHEN IT HAPPENED.      I DID SOME RESEARCH THIS EVENING AND FOUND THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED TO A COUPLE IN MONTREAL LAST JANUARY AND FOUND REPORTS OF THIS HAPPENING 2 OTHER TIMES WITH THE EXACT SAME MAKE, MODEL & YEAR JEEP.  *TR",
