After my son and I tried unsuccessfully to find the problem we contacted our Jeep dealership, but couldn\u2019t get an appointment until mid September to have it checked. They found that it was an internal problem and the unit needs to be replaced. However the parts are unavailable at this time from their supplier. Apparently this has been a problem with other owners and the supplier said that Jeep is  changing the cluster unit and the new ones won\u2019t be available to order until November 20th. I believe this is a safety issue since the driver is unable to monitor issues using the instrument cluster and it occurred suddenly and obviously has happened to other owners and therefore a recall should be issued and the problem fixed.",

I own a Mopar premier extended warranty covering the vehicle for 7 years, or 100,000 miles, whatever comes first.    My complaint, which I believe creates a severe safety hazard on a public roadway, is the inner front fender wheel lines have failed on three different occasions requiring replacement.  When the liners fail, it leaves exposed the 4  individual brake lines from the master cylinder.  Road debris, when the inner fender wheel well is missing, can easily strick the brake lines by road debris thrown from the front tire while driving leading to brake failure and loss of control which can result in injury up to and including death to the driver, occupants, or others.  I have contacted corporate Jeep on two different occasions to ask for repairs, and they refused to correct the issue.  Their position is the vehicle is beyond the 3 year, 36,000 mile initial warranty, and my extended warrenty will not cover the repair as this wheel well liner is considerd a \"trim piece\".  I am looking to NHTSA for assistance as this failure is something that should be mandated for a safety recall, and the dealer has told me the design of the liner on the JL series is prone  to failure.  I have owned 4 other Jeep Rubicon's over the past 10-15 years, and this has not been an issue on my other vehicles prior to the redesign of current Jeep Wrangler JL series.  I have filed a complaint with Jeep, and they refuse to escallate my issue.  The dealer says they cannot address the issue without corporate approval, and Jeep does not have a work flow to escallate the issue internally.  I have photos which will clearly show the exposed 4 brake lines at the upper edge of the frame rail.  I attempted to upload 8 photos of approximately 80-90 KB each.  Your web portal would not accept any photos.  Help me submit photos for review.",

This happened pretty much after we got it but just thought this was a feature of the jeep modularity so we would just push it back in. Now this started happening on driver side and I see this as a safety issue as this can obscure vision at the wrong time. I went to dealer/manufacturer(Jeep) and they do not see this as a defect worthy of replacing outside of their standard 3 year warranty. I had purchased an extended warranty from the dealer from Mastertech and they would not cover it either.   This issue appears to be common defect in manufacturing design over several years over several lines of Jeep versions and I am shocked that something like this that could theoretically impair line of site for the driver while driving has not been addressed by Jeep. I am equally shocked that NHTSA has not pursued and or forced a safety recall for this.  I have never had a car drop its visor and with this jeep both visors do this for a vehicle that gets very little use(under 30k miles).",

        "summary": "While traveling on the interstate 3 months ago, my 2020 Jeep Wrangler began to vibrate violently after driving over a seam in the road while traveling around 70mph. After slowing down and pulling over, I assessed the exterior of the car and tires for any obvious defects and continued on without identifying any structural problems. Within the next 20 miles the violent reverberations occurred again. We pulled over, concerned that something catastrophic could occur and brought the Jeep to a local mechanic. The mechanic suggested that the wheels should be balanced which we complied with, although we had just recently had a tire rotation and balance prior to this trip, but thought perhaps the violent shaking caused the tires to misalign. That same day, we searched online to see if others had experienced a similar phenomenon and learned about the \"death wobble\". We called Jeep that day and they would neither confirm nor deny that the Jeep was safe to drive for the remainder of our trip.  We continued on at a lower speed and encountered the same problem the following day. We feel this vehicle is unsafe to drive and Jeep has informed us that they do not have enough parts to fix our Jeep because of the volume of affected vehicles. We\u2019ve been on a waitlist for the part for the past 3 months.",

        "summary": "An internal defect in the 2014-2020 Jeep Wranglers with the 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine affects its rocker arms, lifters, and related valvetrain components, including the engine control module (ECM) software that controls the precise timing and function of the lifters. Specifically, the rollers of a Pentastar engine\u2019s rocker arms prematurely wear down, become loose, and then drop, which shifts the rocker arm out of alignment. The rocker arms then come into contact with the cam, scraping both components and creating metal debris. This Pentastar V6 engine defect creates an audible ticking sound that stems from metal particles and debris from the failed rocker arms and other components, contaminating the engine oil and circulating throughout the engine. This defect also causes engine misfires, resulting in bucking and surging, decreased engine performance, hesitation, loss of power, premature wear on internal components, and eventually catastrophic engine failure.   The check engine light came on in my 2020 Jeep Wrangler with 69,000 miles. After having it read by a dealer, it showed the P219A code, Bank 1 air/fuel imbalance. The dealership told me that if the Jeep was running fine, I did not have to worry about it, as it was likely an O2 sensor. The code was cleared, and the P219A code returned the following day. It was driven approximately 500 miles before noticing that it began idling roughly and had an engine tick, which the dealership confirmed to be a valvetrain issue. The rocker arms, lifters, valves, and camshaft components of the Pentastar V6 engine in my 2020 Jeep Wrangler with 70,000 miles have failed. Three Jeep dealerships in my area and MANY online forums stated that this is a common occurrence with this engine, which has escalated my concern about this problem.",

        "summary": "I just purchased my 4th Wrangler last month from a dealership - a 2020 Certified Pre-Owned Unlimited Sport Willys 2.0L with Automatic transmission.   Within the first days, I noticed odor of fuel or exhaust that would be more obvious some times than others, and not constantly strong or apparent. At first I thought maybe it was from being in garage at dealer and something on a mat, but then it continued and was more apparent if I had the windows closed and the heat on.  Called the dealer two weeks ago and got an appointment to have it checked this past Friday.  First I was told I\u2019m probably not used to it if it\u2019s my first \u201cturbo\u201d (which made no sense), then they came back to tell me it\u2019s probably dirty air filters (which they should\u2019ve checked/changed when they inspected it before selling it because it was at 31,200mi).   Then they decided to take it for a ride and, lo and behold, they smelled what I have been smelling. They put it back on the lift to look again.   Diagnosis: Fuel leak from the connector to the high pressure fuel line.   I see there were some JLs with 2.0L manufactured the same year recalled for this, but they insisted mine wasn\u2019t. Search online confirms it\u2019s not included in the recall. I had no luck getting anywhere when I called Jeep customer service either.  The dealer wants to charge me my extended warranty deductible when I haven\u2019t even made my first payment on it yet. (According to vehicle records, 3 years for manufacturer warranty was up Nov 2022, and it has less than 32,500mi.)  They insisted they keep it while waiting for the part for repair because it\u2019s unsafe to drive, and put me in a rental (which they told me they didn\u2019t have available when I asked for the appointment).   I think this is clearly a safety issue consistent with other recalls for this model and should be repaired at no cost to me. Perhaps the initial recall didn\u2019t include all the vehicles it should have.",

The violent shaking and noise scared both me and my daughter who was a passenger.  Weeks later I got a notice of a class-action lawsuit regarding this issue and the steering damper. I brought it in for service and they fixed it.  However, it was NOT covered by Chrysler so I am stuck with the deductible.

I was driving North on I-15 about 10 miles South of Nephi, UT.  I was traveling in the left lane at Freeway speeds (75-80 mph) when the front of the vehicle commenced to shake violently.  My first thought was that both front tires had blown, although I did not observe any obstacles on the wet driving lanes.  My second thought was, how do I get out of these mess without causing a major accident on that very busy stretch of Freeway holiday traffic? I, of course, braked and pulled to the left in an attempt to avoid getting rear-ended and immediately encountered snow and ice on the left shoulder and then on the ground adjacent to the Freeway.  I managed to get off the Freeway, but continued to fishtail, almost losing control on the snow and ice.  Eventually the vehicle ended up in a sideways slide perpendicular to the Freeway with the front of the vehicle aimed at the Freeway and heavy TRAFFIC!  At that point I had no control over the vehicle as it continued to slide sideways headed for a huge drainage ditch.  Luckily, we stopped before the precipice. I scrambled out of the vehicle as soon as it stopped sliding to see what had happened to the front end of the Jeep.  There was no obvious damage, the tires were not flat, and I couldn\u2019t figure out what had happened. I have now received a NOTICE OF PROPOSED CLASS SETTLEMNT, that upon further research informs me that 2020 Jeep Wranglers have a manufacture defect that causes the \u2018Death Wobble\u2019 in precisely the conditions that existed with me.  \u201c\u20262020 Jeep Wranglers \u2026have a front suspension steering damper defect that causes the steering wheel and front suspension of the vehicle to shake after contact with a bumpy road surface at highway speed.\u201d   I was not aware of the Manufacturer's defect.

        "summary": "I was driving my 2020 Jeep Wrangler Sahara with 34,950 miles on it on the night of 12/13/2022 along I 89 in New Hampshire at a steady 65mph in 6th gear in the far-left lane. Suddenly the tachometer started soaring towards the redline. Before it hit redline, there was an explosion underneath the Jeep. As I looked in the mirror to get to the side of the road, I saw two chunks of glowing hot metal exiting the underside. There were no warning lights or other indication of what was about to happen. I got it safely to the breakdown lane. Someone called in a small brush fire because a fire truck showed up, then a couple of State Police Troopers showed up and helped call a tow truck. It cost $350 for the tow to the nearest dealership and the Uber home. At the dealership I could see a huge crack in the transmission case. From the repair order included, there was damage to the clutch, transmission, starter, flywheel, electrical harness and main seal. I was told the faulty parts were returned to Jeep for inspection. There was a recall on the clutch pressure plate (21V-028) and the \"repair\" had been completed on my vehicle. The \"repair\" did not work and people are going to get hurt. Although no one was injured this time, this could have ended very badly if the hot metal shrapnel cut a tire or hit a car behind me. From my little bit of research, this failure is becoming quite common and many people are driving a ticking time bomb.",

When the visor pops out of place, it hangs by the wires for visor mirror lighting.  I purchased my vehicle new Feb 2020, and my vehicle currently only has about 10,500 miles.  The visor began popping out of place around April/May 2022.  The visor popping out of place is dangerous because  1) it happens WHILE driving, especially over rough roads, and this obscures my view of the road (!!!), 2) it has happened multiple times, unpredictably, and 3) I cannot use the visor to block out bright light while driving because it falls out if I fold down the visor, which makes it difficult to drive comfortably around sunrise or sunset.  On August 15th, 2022 went to the dealer where I purchased the vehicle (Autonation Jeep Bellevue in Washington state) to get this problem looked at as my vehicle is still under warranty.  The service center confirmed the problem, as mentioned in the invoice, and they mentioned they would have to replace the entire sun visor assembly.  However, I have not heard back from the dealer concerning replacement as likely the parts are on back order.  The pictures I provided are for the visor popped out showing the visor popped out of place when it was supposed to be in the folded up, out of the way position, and the folded down position as well as the hinge that seems to pop out of place.  According to different forums of owners of Wrangler JL like mine, visors popping out of place are frequent problems, and replacing the visor with the same visor assembly only temporarily fixes the problem because replacement does nothing about the bad design that leads to the visor falling out of place.",

If you press and hold the clutch to the floor and release it slowly you can feel it bind up. 3 things normally happen. #1. It will stick to the floor #2. It will stick for a short time and as you raise your foot, the pedal will hit the bottom of your foot, jerking the jeep forward. #3 it does release as normal.   I have taken the Jeep to the dealer last year 8/21 and they couldn't replicate the issue. However they reported a leaky hose that they replaced. I couldn't identify any hoses that were newly replaced. It has gotten progressively worse and now I can replicate the issue after a few attempts.   When at a complete stop pointing uphill there is a risk of rolling back into another vehicle if the clutch doesnt engage. Transitioning from a complete stop to moving forward is not very smooth if the clutch pops up on its own. Sometimes it ends up in the engine stopping and having to restart the vehicle.  The Jeep is available for inspection. I have tried to schedule another repair but waiting for a response from the Dealer. The Jeep has other recalls for the clutch and I believe all recalls have been applied to the vehicle.  I have an email that I sent to the dealer with photos that I sent to the dealer when I first noticed this issue. I can also try to find the invoice from last year.",

        "summary": "My vehicle is still at the Jeep dealership service center being repaired, but so far, the reported issue includes a \"shorted\" fuse block. As I was driving the vehicle, I was approaching a red light when my vehicle abruptly halted. The cars behind & near me were forced to go around to avoid hitting my vehicle. The dashboard initially flashed the message \"safety mode\" or something similar, the check engine light came on, the brakes locked, & the power steering & windows ceased to function. While I waited for the police, I tried to restart the vehicle many times, in hopes of getting it into neutral and/or getting it off of the roadway - nothing worked.  The vehicle then began to flash the message \"Service Electronic Stability Control.\" The DOTD serviceman & the tow truck driver were unable to get the vehicle into neutral manually, so it had to be dragged using chains.  Once the vehicle was towed to the Jeep dealership (Covington, LA), I was first told that the battery had a voltage of 0. After replacing the battery, I was told that the fuse block was shorted. The representative explained the fuse block's purpose, & further explained that because mine shorted, the battery was unable to communicate with the rest of the vehicle, like the alternator & the PCM, on how much voltage was coming out of the system - i.e., since my computer shorted, the vehicle did not know that the battery was dead. Thus, when the battery killed abruptly while driving, the vehicle basically panicked & went into \u201csafe mode\u201d (limp mode) & locked up the entire machine.  I asked repeatedly how this happens and how it can be avoided in the future, and while dancing around many indirect answers, the rep stated that my fuse block in this instance basically caused a complete electronic failure of the vehicle. I am an attorney & I have spoken with experts who suggest that this issue should be investigated. It is a serious hazard & a defect for one glitched part to kill the entire machine while driving.",

Trying to pass and losing power I had to return to my previous lane and forced several vehicles to slam on their brakes in my previous lane so I could return. Loosing power trying to enter the passing lane forced the vehicle to slam on their brakes that I had just merged into. On another 2 other occasions vehicle looses power when trying to merge onto freeway. First occasion I was able to pull off to shoulder to avoid flowing traffic. Second incident there was no shoulder when merging onto freeway. Semi truck changed lanes to avoid my vehicle because I could not accelerate to speed. These incidents seem to happen with altitude and freeway driving speeds. There are no engine codes showing. This recent incident happened in the Shasta pass area.",

This recently caused an issue where a group of people walked behind my Jeep while pulling out. Both myself and the group were fortunate enough that I caught one of the people walking behind my Jeep and stopped before backing into them with the backup camera still showing a clear path.  This issue has been documented with Jeep and was serviced November of 2021.  They replaced the unit but after a few months the new head unit started crashing and I am still having this intermittent issue where the screen shows a static image for the rear view upon placing the Jeep in reverse.  No warning lamps or messages are shown.  Eventually the watchdog timer times out after about a minute and the system reboots.    The head unit will also crash randomly at other times while driving but this is the only instance it puts safety at risk.  I would estimate it occurs 2-5% of the time I back out.  Before I took the Jeep in for service I documented, in detail, each time the unit crashed and gave it to the service tech, I will send it to you as well when I locate the file.  I also attached links to video showing a 2 examples at various different times this occurred, including an instance today.  https://photos.app.goo.gl/pvrpoP44CjFHHfvN6 https://photos.app.goo.gl/ALu3dAw6Sarz3jzJ6",

        "summary": "Driving on I-35 North (Texas) in the morning requires driving directly into the sun rise. I utilize my sun visor daily in order to maintain a safe view of the road, where people are frequently driving over 80 miles per hour. One morning on the way to work, I put my sun visor down so that I could see past the sun glare on my windshield. The sun visor then fell from its open position as I went over a bump in the road. At this point, the visor was hanging several inches lower than it normally does, almost completely obscuring my view of the road. The visor was not able to fall completely, because it was attached to the top of the car via electrical wiring. If it had fallen completely, I would have been in a much safer position. I needed to pull over ASAP but was unable to do so due to the construction on the highway and therefore had to hold the visor up with one hand while driving with the other until I could find a safe place to stop. The visor is still in the same state as it was when it initially failed. I have had to tape it up and am therefore unable to use it at all. There is no replacement part for the failed piece of plastic within the visor's housing. It requires replacement of the entire assembly, and that will contain the same part that failed in the first place. This seems to be a fairly common problem and has been discussed at length online, including at this website: https://www.jlwranglerforums.com/forum/threads/sun-visor-fix.44865/",

I was assured by the dealer this was standard. I previously owned a 2016 Jeep Wrangler (previous generation) that did not have the same looseness in steering. At my dealer's recommendation, I purchased and had them install a new steering stabilizer ($250) and upgraded control arms ($400). This helped the handling of the vehicle but did not improve the steering. I recently had the TSB  08-074-20 performed which replaced the steering gear box. It did not improve the steering at all and it continues to be loose. I can turn the steering wheel from 10 oclock to 2oclock and the wheels do not turn at all. This makes it incredibly difficult to drive, especially at high speed. I do not feel safe driving this vehicle above 55mph, especially around curves on the highway.",

I turned it off again and after about 15 minutes, my steering wheel was unlocked. I took my car to the dealership and had them take a look at it. A few days later, they \"fixed\" it and told me it was a battery issue and that it was resolved. Two days later, the exact same thing happened AGAIN while I was on a 1 way street. It was INCREDIBLY dangerous, because it happened right before I had to go up an S curve. It was in the middle of a storm and there were a lot of cars going the other way and a lot of cars behind me. I turned on my hazard lights and had to go up the curve very slowly and there was somewhere I could turn right. Since my steering wheel was locked, I wasn't able to turn onto the street and ended up in a patch of grass. My car is currently at the dealership again. They told me it was a wiring issue and they are going to keep it and test drive it a few times.",

I AM LOVING EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CAR EXCEPT THE STEERING. THE STEERING ON THIS VEHICLE IS TERRIBLE AND DANGEROUS!!! THE STEERING IS LOOSE AND ON IT'S OWN, IT WILL DRIFT OR FLOAT TO EITHER SIDE, RIGHT OR LEFT, ON A SMOOTH DRY SURFACE AT VIRTUALLY ANY SPEED. IT IS EVEN WORSE AT HIGHER SPEEDS.  IT CANNOT STEER STRAIGHT LIKE ANY NORMAL VEHICLE.   THIS IS A SERIOUSLY DANGEROUS PROBLEM THAT JEEP SHOULD BE INSTITUTING A RECALL AND REPAIR ORDER FOR! I'VE INSTRUCTED MY FAMILY MEMBERS TO CONTACT OUR ATTORNEY IF ANYONE IS INVOLVED IN A CRASH WITH THIS VEHICLE THAT RECEIVES INJURY, SERIOUS BODILY INJURY OR DEATH. MY FAMILY MEMBERS WILL INFORM OUR ATTORNEY THAT THIS DANGEROUS PROBLEM EXISTED SINCE THE DAY IT WAS PURCHASED AND THAT THE MANUFACTURER (JEEP) KNEW ABOUT THIS FROM NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS FROM CUSTOMERS, AND YET SO FAR HAS FAILED TO INSTITUTE A RECALL FOR REPAIR.  CHECK ONLINE AND YOU WILL FIND MANY OWNERS COMPLAINING ABOUT THEIR NEW WRANGLER'S STEERING PROBLEM. ONLINE AFTERMARKET COMPANIES ARE ATTEMPTING TO SELL PRODUCTS THAT \"MAY\" RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. WHY SHOULD ANY NEW OWNER HAVE TO SPEND MONEY ON AN AFTER MARKET PRODUCT FOR A BRAND NEW CAR? IF JEEP DOES NOT INITIATE A RECALL, I WILL WRITE COMPLAINTS AND NEGATIVE REVIEWS EVERYWHERE I CAN AND THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME I PURCHASE ONE.
