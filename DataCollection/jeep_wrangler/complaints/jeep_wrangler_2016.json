My 2nd issue is my TPM system has been blinking and does not show the pressure on very hot days. Both issues have been going on for over a year. 3rd issue is I can no longer use the AM/FM radio.  4th issue is my brakes went out due to a faulty rear passenger side brake hose in March.  Over the past 2 weeks something has been wrong with using my brakes. Today I just found out both front brake hoses are defective. Due to these defective hoses, my rotors also need to be replaced. My  automotive mechanic said this is very common. My car only has 54k miles on it. I feel like these issues should not be happening on a car that only has 54K miles on it. I feel like many children are in danger because of these hoses being defective. What if a parent has this happen and they are unable to stop on the interstate or anywhere really. I almost wrecked when my brakes went out in March, but luckily I was able to stop before hitting anything. The car behind me almost hit me as well. Can you please investigate these issues as soon as possible before anyone gets seriously hurt. Thank you.",

I was unable to move over to the right lane of the highway because the Jeep was crawling to a stop and cars were flying past me in the right lane. No warning lights or check engine lights ever came on.  My daughter was in the Jeep with me. She called 911. The Jeep came to a complete stop and died. We were stuck in the vehicle and could not exit because cars were speeding past us on both sides of the vehicle. We were almost hit from behind by a semi trailer. It swerved to the right lane at the last moment. We called 911 again and they said police were on the way. A vehicle stopped in the right lane and let my daughter and I exit the Jeep on the passenger side.  My daughter was crying hysterically because she was so shook up from almost being hit by the semi trailer. Police finally arrived and called a tow truck. The Jeep was towed to the dealer where it was purchased.  The service department inspected the Jeep. Said the Jeep did not register any codes. It started and was driving normal. They say it could be the fuel pump.  I\u2019ve ordered a fuel pump but it is unavailable at this time. Not sure when it will come into the dealer. In the meanwhile, I\u2019m terrified that this will happen again. I will not be driving it on the highway at all and will only drive it when necessary to run errands. The vehicle has not been inspected by anyone other than the service department at the dealer where the Jeep was purchased.",

In October 2016, I purchased new, a Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon from York Chrysler in Prescott, Arizona, VIN: [XXX]. Sometime after the purchase, the vehicle began to have a disturbing, recurring problem.   While in normal operation, the engine will stop.  It is as if the ignition has been turned off.  The drill I have developed is, while the Jeep is coasting, to shift to Neutral, re-start the engine, shift to Drive, and proceed.  Sometimes, the Check Engine Light activates, and sometimes, although less frequently, this is accompanied with the Electrical Stability Control (ESC) Off indicator light. The first time I documented the phenomenon with a visit to the dealership was 17 May 2023.  However, I believe that the problem had happened several times prior to that date. Since then, the vehicle has exhibited this problem numerous times; sometimes at a stop, more often while proceeding in normal operation. The engine has stalled several times on the Phoenix, Arizona, freeway system during heavy traffic.  Today, the engine stalled again, but would NOT re-start while coasting.  I was forced to come to a complete stop, shift to Park, re-start, shift to Drive, and proceed. Often after a re-start, the transmission has difficulty in going into gear, even while in Drive. I have been advised at the dealership that the problem has occurred many times, to many drivers, but that Chrysler cannot diagnose the problem, and thus can\u2019t fix it. Logic suggests that if a collision has not yet been precipitated by this condition, it surely will be\u2026 I have discovered that a class-action suite is being considered.  Chrysler must be very aware of the problem, yet is effectively forcing owners of the affected vehicles to operate unsafe Jeeps on the public streets. In my opinion, the Federal Government needs to intervene with a mandatory recall.  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",

Airbags have not been inspected by anyone. Only the damages were inspected by the insurance carrier. No warning lights, messages or symptoms prior to the accident.",

Has my jeep wrangler 2016 had any recalls. My son died December 10, 2019. I have never had any other problems with my jeep wrangler. I believe in jeep and the company who makes them. The body shop told me to get rid of my jeep. I cannot do that and since my son died in my jeep wrangler and drug dealers threw him in the back seat, letting him die after they stuck him with a needle full of fentanyl. Please help I do not want to part with my jeep wrangler. I am sure with the Vin number you will be able to trace anything that has gone on with my Jeep! I could have missed many recalls because my son was very sick, from 2016 until his death 2019.  I purchased the car brand new in 2016 in upstate New York. Please tell me how I can get help so my seatbelt will work again and the airbag can be inspected. It must be a recall issue I can\u2019t think of anything else and I need your help. I now live in Port Charlotte, Florida, and I am near my daughter. This jeep wrangler has been very good to us. It saved my son\u2019s life and his girlfriends in that prior accident. Something is very wrong with the seatbelts and possibly the mechanisms attached to the seat, bag, and seatbelts. I\u2019m not sure. But the jeep  is a fantastic vehicle and I love it.

All oil poured out of vehicle and would not hold any oil when more was added. Took vehicle to Jeep dealer and they confirmed that the PLASTIC piece that was the original part cracked and that this is a very common problem for 2014-2017 Jeeps due to the part being plastic. Part is not covered under any warranty and will cost $1200 to repair. I'm told that the replacement parts have been updated and are no longer made of plastic due to the high instance of problems. All research shows that this was to be a recall but that it has not been made official. This is a huge safety concern as the oil completely drained from the vehicle upon crack. Had I not been in my own driveway and driving down the highway, this would have caused major issues, engine failure and very possibly an accident. We were planned to be on a 6hr road trip moments before this occurred in the driveway. This part needs to be recalled and replaced by the manufacturer since it is a common and known problem with many Jeeps manufactured during that time frame.",

I bought the replacement lines and they have the exact same defect.  Poor engineering here. The metal should not clamp the hose but be rolled around it so the hose has some clearance.  I do not know who to report this to but I paid the dealer $180 to lie to me about it needing calipers rotors and hoses.  Took it home and I diagnosed the issue.  Spent around $200 for new hoses and my labor to change them out and bleed the system. I have temporarily put on the oem lines but am looking for some better aftermarket alternatives as the replacement is crimped and will fail soon. The left front caliper seized up locally.  Right one was bad also.  So glad it seized near our neighborhood.",

SO, I PAID $400 TO REPLACE ENTIRE SEAT BELT (MY HUSBAND   THOUGHT THE DOG HAD CHEWED), NOT REALIZING THE DEFECT HAD OCCURRED LONG   BEFORE WE HAD GOTTEN  THE PUPPY. THE WORK WAS DONE AT OHARA IN FALMOUTH. WAIT   FOR PARTS WAS ABSURD. CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE. NOT EVEN A MONTH   AFTER THE WORK WAS COMPLETED AND THE SEATBELT TORN AGAIN.! AT THIS POINT, I INSPECTED ALL MY SEATBELTS  AND NOTICES THAT BOTH REAR SEATBELTS (NOT THE MIDDLE) AND THE FRONT PASSENGER BELT ALL HAVE THE SAME EXACT TEAR TIGHT WHERE THE BUCKLE FALLS ON THE BELT. I WOULD LOVE TO BLAME THE DO, BUT THE DOG HAS NOT BEEN ALLOWED IN THE VEHICLE SINCE THE REPAIR. JEEP/CHRYSLER DOES NOT SEEMS TO BELIEVE THAT THIS A PRODUCT QUALITY DEFECT OR A MANUFACTURER ISSUE. THEY ALSO HAVE NO EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THE SEATBELTS ARE TEARING AND CLAIM THAT IT MUST BE SOMETHING THAT I AM DOING WITH THE VEHICLE. CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT I HAVE ONLY HAD 4 PASSENGERS RIDE IN MY BACKSEAT SINCE THE REPAIRS , I AM BAFFLED. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN. I WOULD THINK SEATBELTS SHOULD BE FAIRLY DURABLE, BUT THESE ARE NOT. I AM DISGUSTED AT CHRYSLER'S RESPONSE AND AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THESE BELTS. I CANNOT SPEND $1200 TO REPLACE BELTS THAT MAY ONLY LAST A MONTH! I HAVE ATTACHED PICS  THIS DEFECT.      EATBELTS AND I HAVE WASTED OVER $400(PLUS$35 FOR A REJECTION STICKER) ON  A REPAIR THAT DID NOT FIX THE DEFECT IN THE SEAT BELT. DEALERSHIP HAS   BEEN NO HELP. THIS IS NOT ONLY VERY DISAPPOINTING, BUT VERY INCONVENIENT  ; AS WE CAN NOT USE THE REAR SEATS WITH OUT SEATBELTS AND THEREFORE THIS  IS A MAJOR SAFE TY ISSUE.

IT FELT LIKE IT HAD TWISTED SIDEWAYS AND FALLEN DOWN. TO GET IT INTO 1ST GEAR, I HAD TO SHOVE IT FAR TO THE LEFT TOWARD THE STEERING WHEEL, AND FOR 2ND GEAR, I HAD TO PRACTICALLY JAM THE SHIFTER INTO MY LEG. FINDING NEUTRAL AND REVERSE WAS TRICKY--THE WHOLE SHIFTER MECHANISM FELT LIKE BROKEN BONES AND MUSH. I WAS ABLE TO GET IT HOME (THANKFULLY A SHORT DRIVE ON BACK ROADS WHERE I COULD GO SLOW AND THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC) BUT WAS BAFFLED BY HOW IT WAS FINE EARLIER, THEN SUDDENLY JUNK. THANKFULLY I WAS NOT ON THE HIGHWAY OR ON A TRIP SOMEWHERE WITH MY DAUGHTER IN THE JEEP. A TOW TRUCK PICKED IT UP THIS MORNING AT OUR HOME BECAUSE DRIVING IT 16 MILES TO THE DEALER IN THE CITY IN HEAVY TRAFFIC (NOT KNOWING IF SHIFTING WOULD BE AN OPTION) SEEMED VERY DANGEROUS. THE REP AT THE JEEP DEALER SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE, HOWEVER I DISCOVERED MANY PEOPLE ON WRANGLERFORUM.COM HAVE REPORTED THE EXACT SAME ISSUE. WITHOUT HEARING BACK FROM THE DEALER YET TO VERIFY, IT APPEARS TO BE THE 52060064AG LEVER GEARSHIFT / BUSHING THAT HAS MALFUNCTIONED/BROKEN. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT MY FIRST EVER AMERICAN MADE VEHICLE FEELS LIKE CHEAP JUNK. IN ADDITION TO THIS POTENTIALLY VERY SERIOUS ISSUE, THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER MINOR IRRITATING ISSUES SUCH AS THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR SIMPLY FALLING OFF WHILE DRIVING, AND THE FENDER OVER THE REAR WHEEL FALLING OFF. THINGS LIKE THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN WITH A NEW \"TOUGH\" (AND RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE) VEHICLE. I AM DISAPPOINTED AND, FRANKLY, PISSED. DOES QUALITY EVEN EXIST ANYMORE?",
