Not only is this manufactured defect a COSTLY inconvenience, BUT A POSSIBLY DANGEROUS SITUATION.  Not to mention stinking like gasoline when I arrive at my destination, which was Sunday church service the last time.  Research has shown me there has been recalls for this issue on jeeps very near my vehicle's \"birthday\".  I grew up pumping gas for my parents at the station, but now I have to be sure there is a \"splash zone\" of at least 5 feet of distance from the filler so innocent bystanders don't get splattered.  I have been verbally attacked numerous times at the pump because of this manufacturer defect.  Now I know perfection can be unattainable, lots of quirky parts in vehicles today, but i can honestly say this situation alone is keeping me from being an advocate of what i once thought was a great buy.  I have replaced the steering damper that created the now legendary death wobble, and personally dealt with evap system part failures.  Repairing those issues myself doesn't bother me, but the fuel tank is another story.  This is something that should absolutely be addressed.  If Im required by the government to pass an e-check so minimal fumes don't enter the atmosphere, then this needs to be replaced/corrected IMMEDIATELY because all these jeeps are dumping fuel on the ground all over the world!  Also Ive learned about a mopar replacement filler tube with a check valve built in.  I feel this issue should be recognized as a recall, or exposed for the environmental hypocrisy it creates.",

Nothing changes , the fuel still blows out. Sometimes even if you pump slow it will still spew back out. Not every station has the rubber splash guards on their nozzles.    The reason this is a danger is very obvious. Gasoline has a low flash point , not to mention the health risk of the vapors.  One freak spark unrelated to me fueling could have deadly consequences.    I spoke to jeep headquarters about this issue. They refused to give me the lot number for the faulty fuel tanks. The fuel tanks that had issues was on 2008 and earlier jeep Wranglers. Our jeep was manufactured in 2/2009 and from what I have gathered uses the exact  same tank as the 2008 and earlier tanks back to a certain year.  Is it to far fetched to believe that the tank installed  could be faulty , just like the earlier ones.      Just so we are clear this has been occuring since we purchased the jeep and continues to.  I would like jeep to replace the tank or the valve in the tank. They could install the retro fit repair . I don't feel as an owner we should have the Burden of replacing the tank.",

I PULLED OVER, SHUT OFF MY VEHICLE AND OPENED THE HOOD. THERE WAS A FIRE ON THE PASSANGER SIDE OF MY VEHICLE UNDER AND BEHIND MY BATTERY, ROLLING UNDER THE VEHICLE MOVING VERY QUICKLY. I IMMEDIATELY CLOSED THE HOOD, GOT MY BELONGING OUT OF MY VEHICLE AND WATCHED AS IT BLEW UP, AND I CALLED 911. MY VEHICLE IS TOTALED.

I HAVE CHECKED WITH CHRYSLER, AND THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE.  IN FACT, A TSB (14-001-11) AS WELL AS A WARRANTY EXTENSION WAS ISSUED FOR THIS PROBLEM, BUT THE THE EXTENSION WAS ONLY ISSUED FOR 2007 AND 2008 MODELS.  MY MODEL (2009) IS THE SAME VEHICLE, HOWEVER, I AM NOT BEING AFFORDED (BY CHRYSLER) THE SAME CONSIDERATION SIMPLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT MY MODEL YEAR EXCEEDS 2008.  I VIEW THIS AS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT I AT MANY TIMES, I  HAVE MY CHILDREN IN THE VEHICL WHEN I NEED TO FUEL UP.  I TRULY FEEL THIS PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN RECTIFIED FOR THE 2009 MODEL YEAR, AND FURTHER BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD BE AFFORDED THE SAME BENEFIT TO HAVE THIS FIXED AT NO CHARGE - AS I AM EXPERIENCING THE IDENTICAL ISSUE.  AGAIN, THIS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AS IT REALLY IS A SAFETY ISSUE.  PLEASE NOTE THAT I SELECTED THAT THERE WAS AN \"INJURY\" DUE TO THE FACT THAT I HAD BEEN COVERED IN GASOLINE, WHICH IS KNOWN TO BE TOXIC.  -THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP/CONSIDERATION.

I DID SOME RESEARCH AND LEARNED THAT THIS SYMPTOM IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH MY MODEL YEAR OF VEHICLE AND HAS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH MODEL YEARS 2007 AND UP.  THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE CLOCKSPRING MECHANISM IN THE STEERING COLUMN THAT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE AIR BAG. IT APPARENTLY HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE FUNCTION OF THE AIRBAG AND IS ALREADY THE SUBJECT OF RECALLS ON OTHER MODEL YEARS AS WELL AS A RECALL ON THE 2009 RHD VERSION OF THE WRANGLER. THEY CLEARLY ARE USING THE SAME PART ON THESE MODELS AND SHOULD BE A RECALL ON ALL MODELS THAT HAVE THIS PART. I BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALER TO GET FIXED AND JEEP DETERMINED THAT IT WAS A FAULTY CLOCKSPRING MECHANISM AND I HAD IT REPLACED AS IT OBVIOUSLY IS A SAFETY RISK. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS AND HAVE THEM RECALL ALL MODELS WITH THE SAME CLOCKSPRING MECHANISM BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT OR KILLED. I AM CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING WITH CHRYSLER CORPORATION REGARDING THIS REPAIR BUT I PAID FOR THE ENTIRE REPAIR MYSELF. *TR",

THE DAY IT STARTED WE WERE TAKING A TRIP TO NEW ORLEANS AND IT HAPPENED 6 OR 7 TIMES IN LESS THAN 100 MILES.  I WILL BE TAKING IT IN TO THE DEALER IN THE MORNING, BUT AFTER A QUICK SEARCH OF THE NHTSA DATABASE IT SEEM THIS HAS BEEN A REGULAR OCCURRENCE AND RECURRENCE WITH JEEPS FOR MANY YEARS.  LUCKILY WE WERE ON A SECONDARY HIGHWAY WHEN THIS OCCURRED AND NOT ON A MAJOR INTERSTATE AT 70-75 MPH (YET).  THE WIFE IS NOW TERRIFIED TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE AND I'M NOT TO COMFORTABLE WITH IT AT THIS POINT.  TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE WE'RE BEING STATIONED OVERSEAS AND PLANNED ON LETTING OUR SON IN COLLEGE USE THE VEHICLE WHICH DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A GREAT OPTION AT THIS POINT.  WE'VE ALSO NOTICED, FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS, THE MANUAL TRANSMISSION WILL JUMP OUT OF 1ST GEAR WHEN TAKING OFF.

I BELIEVE JEEP SHOULD HAVE TO WARN IT'S POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS IF THEY DO NOT WANT TO BOTHER FIXING AN OBVIOUS DESIGN FLAW AND SHOULD HAVE TO REMOVE ALL THEIR \"TRAIL RATED\" BADGES FROM ALL VEHICLES.
