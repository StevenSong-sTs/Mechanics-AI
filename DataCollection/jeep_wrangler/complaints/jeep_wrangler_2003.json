THE SHAKING STOPPED AFTER SLOWING THE VEHICLE TO ABOUT 30-35 MPH.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER (FRANK PARRA JEEP IN IRVING, TX) FOR INVESTIGATION AND REPAIR.  I WAS INFORMED BY THE SERVICE ADVISOR, JOHN BALLARD, THAT THIS PROBLEM OCCURS FREQUENTLY IN JEEPS AND THAT IT WAS DUE TO THE STEERING DAMPENER.  FRANK PARRA REPLACED THE STEERING DAMPENER.  THE PROBLEM RECURRED IN MARCH 2006 AND I AGAIN TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER.  I WAS INFORMED BY THE SERVICE ADVISOR, TIMOTHY SIMPSON, THAT THE STOCK STEERING DAMPENER WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND THE LOAD IMPOSED BY THE 30 IN. WHEEL GROUP, WHICH COMES STANDARD ON THE SAHARA MODEL, AND THAT I WOULD NEED TO PURCHASE AN UPGRADED STEERING DAMPENER, THE \"RANCHO\" MODEL, BUT THAT IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE DAIMLER CHRYSLER WARRANTY.  WE THOUGHT WE WOULD TRY THE STOCK STEERING DAMPENER AGAIN.  IT FAILED ON THE DRIVE HOME FROM THE DEALER.  I FILED A WARRANTY CLAIM WITH DAIMLER CHRYSLER AND CHECKED TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY SAFETY RECALLS ON THE STEERING DAMPENER.  DAIMLER CHRYSLER DENIED MY CLAIM AND SAID THERE WERE NO RECALLS.  THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME THAT ONLY NHTSA CAN AUTHORIZE A RECALL.  IT SEEMS THAT THE STEERING DAMPENER WAS NOT DESIGNED PROPERLY FOR THE LOADS IMPOSED BY THE STANDARD WHEEL CONFIGURATION AND SHOULD BE UPGRADED SO THAT IT IS ENGINEERED PROPERLY.  ALTHOUGH THIS HAS NOT CAUSED ANY ACCIDENTS OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, IT COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE IN HEAVY TRAFFIC ON THE HIGHWAY AND RAISES THE POSSIBILITY OF CATASTROPHIC FAILURE.  IT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED.  *NM",

SINCE DAY ONE, WHENEVER THE FULL HARD DOOR IS SHUT WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED UP AND THE HARDTOP ON, THE REAR GLASS POPS OPEN. THE REAR GLASS ALSO POPS OPEN WHEN YOU HIT A BUMP IN THE ROAD. THEN THE REAR GLASS JUST FLOPS AROUND AND HITS THE SPARE TIRE AND YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND PUSH IT SHUT, OTHERWISE I'M AFRAID IT MIGHT BREAK THE REAR GLASS. MY MAIN CONCERN IS THAT IT IS A SAFETY HAZARD AS THE OWNER'S MANUAL SAYS TO NEVER DRIVE WITH THE REAR WINDOW OPEN (ON SOFT TOP) UNLESS YOU ALSO HAVE THE FRONT WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN OR EXHAUST FUMES MAY ENTER THE DRIVER/PASSENGER COMPARTMENT AND CAUSE CARBON MONOXIDE POISIONING!  I ASSUME THE SAME THING CAN HAPPEN WITH THE HARD TOP ON WHEN THE REAR GLASS IS OPEN 2-3 INCHES AND FLOPPING AROUND! I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER TWICE AND THEY TRIED LOWERING THE REAR GLASS BY ADJUSTING THE HINGES ON THE GLASS BUT THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS. I CONTACTED JEEP \"STAR\" TECH SUPPORT ON 3 SEPARATE OCCASSIONS AND FILED A COMPLAINT (FILE # 11586375)  THE SERVICE MANAGER AT OUR DEALERSHIP SAID THAT HE HAS SEEN THIS PROBLEM ON SOME OTHER HARD TOP JEEPS AND I ALSO HAVE SEEN THE SAME COMPLAINT ON THE INTERNET ON JEEP FORUM CHAT ROOMS. APPARENTLY  JEEP DOES'T TAKE THE PROBLEM SERIOUSLY SINCE I HAVE OWNED THE VEHICLE FOR 1 1/2 YEARS AND IT HASN'T BEEN FIXED YET. MAYBE WHEN SOMEONE DIES FROM CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING THEY WILL TAKE ACTION!  I BELIEVE THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW. THE 2003 HARDTOP RELIES ON THE REAR TAILGATE TO KEEP THE REAR GLASS CLOSED AND THERE ISN'T ENOUGH OVERLAP TO SECURELY HOLD THE REAR GLASS IN PLACE.*AK",

FIRST WE WERE TOLD THAT THE REPAIRS WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY BECAUSE THE LIFT VOIDED IT.

I WAS TOLD I'D HAVE TO CONTACT THE DEALERSHIP TO SEE IF THEY WOULD STAND BEHIND THE VEHICLE WARRANTY. WE'RE IN TEXAS NOW, THE DEALERSHIP  WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE FROM IS IN WASHINGTON. WE WENT ROUND AND ROUND BETWEEN THE DEALERSHIPS WITH THE ONE IN WASHINGTON SAYING THE VEHICLE WAS COVERED UNDER WARRANTY AND THE ONE IN TEXAS SAYING, \"NO\".  AFTER 3 WEEKS, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY 'MISUSE/ABUSE' BY THE VEHICLE BEING TAKEN OFF-ROAD AND A STICK HITTING THE PLUG ON THE REAR AXLE CAUSING THE FLUID TO LEAK OUT. THE JEEP BROKE DOWN THE DAY AFTER IT WAS TAKEN OFF-ROAD. CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH TIME FOR ANY FLUID TO LEAK OUT, ESPECIALLY WITH NO SIGN OF LEAKAGE ONCE IT WAS PARKED, AND THE VEHICLE WAS DRIVEN LESS THAN 60 MILES THE NEXT DAY. BESIDES, THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN TAKEN 'OFF-ROAD' SINCE WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.

AN ATTEMPT TO GET THE DEALER TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE REPAIR COST TOOK SOME TIME TO GET RESOLVED.  FINALLY, THEY FIXED THE PROBLEMS AND VOIDED THE MANUFACTURE'S WARRANTY.

THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE BECAUSE YOU CANNOT MARKET A VEHICLE AS OFF-ROAD AND THEN VOID THE WARRANTY IF IT IS USED IN THIS MANNER. THE VEHICLE WAS NEVER SUBMERGED, OR IN MUD/WATER DEEPER THEN THE HEIGHT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE FRONT BUMPER.

I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT THE COMPANY WHICH OWNS OF THE DUMP TRUCK BY PHONE, EMAIL, AND REGULAR MAIL (WITH DELIVERY CONFIRMATION), AND HAVE RECEIVED NO RESPONSE. I ALSO SUBMITTED A COMPLAINT TO FAIRFAX COUNTY CONSUMER SERVICES DIVISION BUT WAS TOLD THAT THEY ONLY HANDLE COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE SALE OR PURCHASE OF AN ITEM. BELOW IS A COPY OF THE LETTER I SENT TO OWENS & SPARROW, WHOSE DUMP TRUCK CAUSED THE DAMAGE. I HAVE CONTACTED VDOT AS WELL, BUT WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST YOUR HELP IN ADDITION TO VDOTS. I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT IT IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO REIMBURSE ME FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF MY WINDSHIELD. I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR HELP WITH THIS MATTER.    JUNE 19, 2003    OWEN & SPARROW, LLC  PO BOX 1595  LORTON, VA 22199    DEAR READER:    AT APPROXIMATELY 12:15 P.M. ON THURSDAY, MAY 22, 2003, THE WINDSHIELD OF MY 2002 JEEP WRANGLER WAS STRUCK BY ROCK-LIKE DEBRIS THAT FLEW OUT OF AN OWEN & SPARROW, LLC DUMP TRUCK TRAVELING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME. THIS RESULTED IN TWO CHIPS ON THE DRIVER\u0019S SIDE OF MY WINDSHIELD. AT THAT TIME, I WAS HEADING NORTH ON I395 AND WAS JUST SOUTH OF EXIT 7 (GLEBE ROAD). THE LICENSE PLATE NUMBER OF THAT DUMP TRUCK WAS 604-442; HOWEVER, I WAS UNABLE TO SEE WHICH STATE THE LICENSE PLATE WAS FROM. THE DUMP TRUCK ALSO HAD A 1-800-827-SAFE STICKER ON THE BACK OF IT WITH THE NUMBER PG763.     AS A RESULT OF THIS DAMAGE, I NEED TO HAVE THE WINDSHIELD REPLACED. SINCE I KNOW THAT THIS DAMAGE WAS DIRECTLY CAUSED BY DEBRIS FROM ONE OF YOUR DUMP TRUCKS, I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST REIMBURSEMENT OF $389.82. THIS AMOUNT INCLUDES THE COST OF A REPLACEMENT WINDSHIELD AS WELL AS REPLACEMENT OF TWO DECALS ON THE WINDSHIELD THAT ALSO HAVE TO BE REPLACED (FAIRFAX COUNTY VEHICLE DECAL AND EMISSION INSPECTION DECAL).",
