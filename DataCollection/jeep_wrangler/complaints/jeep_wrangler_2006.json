The frame has rusted through over 50% of the thickness (internally) and has broken through to the outside in several areas around where the suspension and transmission attach.  I recognize that this is an older vehicle, but it has larger percentage of rust than other vehicles I have owned and I do not believe it should be this deteriorated.  I believe there must have been a manufacturing defect in the design (water/dirt) can get trapped in the frame or the material used was of insufficient corrosion resistance. Component Malfunction: Frame Structural Integrity Safety Risk: Drivetrain/Suspension could detach from vehicle causing safety risk to occupant of vehicle or nearby pedestrians/vehicles/structures. Inspected by dealership: Dealership did not mention it, probably because this is a 'known' issue that they don't have a fix for. (Frame replacement is expensive) Inspected by police: Indiana does not require inspections. (No) Warning Lamps: No.  Symptoms appeared in 2020, seem to have accelerated over the last two years/5000 miles.",

It has been also in Central Illinois for about 9 years in a similar environment, and it is known to have the Takata air bag initiator units that are prone to an over 50% dangerous explosion failure rate when actuated.  Given that this vehicle is soon to be exported to an equally high heat and humidity environment in service, may I ask why haven't you required Chrysler/Jeep to recall and repair the units in question?    Given that there are no doubt several million Jeep Wranglers and Wrangler Unlimiteds with these Takata units in them, it is an unconscionable mistake to allow them to continue in daily service in an unrepaired or updated condition.  When, not if these units fail, the results can result in serious injuries and deaths.",

HTTP://WWW.JEEPFORUM.COM/FORUM/F9/GAS-FILLING-OVERFLOW-PROBLEM-645832/  HTTP://WWW.JEEPFORUM.COM/FORUM/F9/FUEL-SPILLING-WHILE-FUELING-NO-MORE-1191442/  HTTP://WWW.JEEPFORUM.COM/FORUM/F9/TROUBLE-FILLING-GAS-TANK-SPURTS-THEN-CLICKS-OFF-679245/  HTTP://WWW.JEEPFORUM.COM/FORUM/F9/GAS-POURS-OUT-649842/  HTTP://WWW.JEEPFORUM.COM/FORUM/F9/GAS-TANK-FILLER-PROBLEM-635636/  HTTP://WWW.JEEPFORUM.COM/FORUM/F9/GAS-EXPLODES-NOT-FIRE-ALL-OVER-ME-WHEN-FILLING-UP-620074/    CHRYSLER HAS YET TO ISSUE A RECALL ON THIS PROBLEM, AND AFTER SPEAKING WITH THE DEALERSHIP, THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME TO FIX IT. JEEP OWNERS HAVE FOUND THAT THE ONLY WAY TO FIX IT IS TO REPLACE THE FILLER TUBE WITH NON-JEEP PARTS (SPECIFICALLY, A CHEVY TRAILBLAZER).    THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. FUEL BELONGS IN A GAS TANK, NOT ON THE GROUND, NOT ON THE DRIVER, NOT SPRAYED ALL OVER THE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE.  *TR",

I WAS STANDING ADJACENT TO MY VEHICLE AS MOST DO WHEN GETTING GAS, I HEARD THE GAS GURGLE LIKE IT NORMALLY DOES, THE PUMP CLICKED OFF AND A SECOND LATER MY EYES WERE SLAMMED SHUT AND BURNING.  AFTER RESEARCHING THE ISSUE I HAVE COME TO FIND THAT CHRYSLER IS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND HAS ACTUALLY TAKEN STEPS TO CORRECT IT IN 2007 AND NEWER VEHICLES.  I DON'T KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT THAT IS TRUE BUT THIS IS A HUGE HAZARD.  THERE IS SOME PLASTIC VALVING WITHIN THE FILLER NECK THAT FAILS TO KEEP FUEL WITHIN THE TANK AND IT IS APPARENTLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE ETHANOL MIXTURE IN GASOLINE.  THAT'S THE EXPLANATION ON MANY WEB SITES.  I DON'T CARE WHAT CAUSES THE ISSUE BUT  IT IS A POOR, DANGEROUS DESIGN.  IF IT WAS A FREAK ISSUE THEN I WOULD TAKE IT IN STRIDE BUT TO FIND THAT CHRYSLER IS AWARE OF IT AND DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT FOR MY MODEL YEAR IS APPALLING.  THIS IS AN ISSUE OF A HIGHLY FLAMMABLE FUEL UNDER PRESSURE BEING PROJECTED UPWARDS TOWARD ANYONE FUELING A VEHICLE AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE NHTSA RECEIVED A REPORT FROM CHRYSLER THAT THE ISSUE EXISTED YET THEY WERE NOT REQUIRED TO RECALL ANY AND ALL VEHICLES EXPERIENCING THE ISSUE.  GASOLINE IN THE EYES IS VERY PAINFUL.  PERIOD.  I WAS UNABLE TO DRIVE FROM THE GAS STATION AND HAD TO HAVE ANOTHER MOTORIST MOVE MY VEHICLE FROM THE PUMPS.  MY DAUGHTER ROUTINELY STANDS BY ME WHEN \"DADDY DOES THINGS\" AND I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW I WOULD HAVE FELT IF SHE WAS THERE THAT DAY.  IN MY OPINION, YOUR AGENCY WAS DEVELOPED IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE MOTORING PUBLIC FROM THIS VERY TYPE OF POOR DESIGN IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY AND I TRUST THAT YOU WILL MAKE IT RIGHT.  *TR",

I CHECKED THE INTERNET AND JEEP FORUM AND FOUND THIS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM WITH JEEP WRANGLERS.

I PULLED OVER ON THE SHOULDER, BUT, TO MY SURPRISE, THE TIRE WAS FINE, AND I COULD SEE NO VISIBLE PROBLEMS.  I PROCEEDED DOWN THE HIGHWAY, BUT, AFTER ABOUT A MILE, THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO SHAKE/WOBBLE WILDLY AGAIN (ALMOST UNCONTROLLABLY), TO THE POINT WHERE I LITERALLY THOUGHT THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL WAS FALLING OFF.  LUCKILY, I WAS ABLE TO PULL TO THE SHOULDER WITHOUT CAUSING AN ACCIDENT.  I DROVE SLOWLY ALONG THE SHOULDER, EXITED THE HIGHWAY AT THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY, AND CALLED THE DEALERSHIP.  AFTER MAKING SURE THAT THE LUG-NUTS WERE TIGHT, I DROVE (VIA CITY STREETS, TO MINIMIZE SPEED) BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN DETERMINED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS WHEEL BALANCING.    THAT SAID, WHEN I HIT A BUMP IN THE ROAD, THE VEHICLE'S RIGHT FRONT END STILL WOBBLES.  IN THE INTERIM, I DID SOME GOOGLE'ING, AND I FOUND THAT NUMEROUS OTHER (?DEATH WOBBLE?) CASES HAVE BEEN REPORTED NATIONWIDE (INCLUDING HUNDREDS TO THE NHTSA).  CHRYSLER HAS ISSUED MULTIPLE TSBS, AND THERE IS A MAINTENANCE NOTICE ACKNOWLEDGING ?STEERING VIBRATION? (A MONUMENTAL EUPHEMISM; THE ISSUE GOES WAY BEYOND A SIMPLE VIBRATION) ON THE JEEP WEBSITE.  IN SHORT, CHRYSLER IS WELL-AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE AND SEVERITY OF THIS PROBLEM.  THE MATTER HAS BEEN ADDRESSED BY A SAN FRANCISCO TV STATION (KGO-TV), AND EVEN TWO MEMBERS OF THE U.S. CONGRESS WHO SENT INQUIRIES/COMPLAINTS TO BOTH CHRYSLER.  DESPITE ALL OF THE FIRST-HAND ACCOUNTS, PUBLICITY, AND REQUESTS FOR ACTION, THE NHTSA HAS DONE NOTHING.    THIS IS CLEARLY A DESIGN FLAW/DEFECT, AND THE NHTSA NEEDS TO FORCE CHRYSLER TO ISSUE A SAFETY RECALL.

THE ONLY WAY TO STOP IT IS TO ACCELERATE TO HIGHER SPEED OR TO SLOW DOWN.   I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND THEY DID A AN ALIGNMENT. THE SHAKING STOPPED AND 1 MONTH LATER IT STARTED AGAIN.  A YEAR LATER, OF JUST PUTTING UP WITH THIS I BRING THE JEEP BACK TO THE DEALER. THEY TELL ME THAT THE CAUSE IS FROM WORN  TIE RODS AND STEERING DAMPER WORN.   IF THIS IS THE CAUSE OF THE SHAKE THEN THEY SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME THIS A YEAR AGO. I THINK THE WORN PARTS ARE A RESULT FROM THE SHAKE. NOT THE CAUSE. EITHER WAY , THE JEEP NOW HAS 26,000 MILES AND I'M ALREADY BEING TOLD TO PUT 2000 DOLLARS INTO IT FOR WORN PARTS. THESE PARTS ARE WEARING PREMATURELY BECAUSE OF THE SHAKE BUT NO ONE CAN DETERMINE THE CAUSE.

I SWAPPED THESE TIRES FROM A 73 CJ5 THAT I JUST WASN'T USING THAT MUCH ANYMORE.  AFTER AROUND 4000-5000 MILES AFTER THE SWITCH THE TIRE POPPED ON ME GOING DOWN THE HIGHWAY DOING 75-80 MPH.  THE VEHICLE SHOOK FOR 2-3 SECONDS THEN I HEARD A \"POP\", INSTANTLY THIS THREW MY VEHICLE WHERE IT FLIPPED AND ROLLED AND TOTALED THE VEHICLE.  I HAD TO BE AIRLIFTED AWAY AS A RESULT OF THIS ACCIDENT.  INVESTIGATORS FROM JEEP AND MY INSURANCE COMPANY BOTH CONCLUDED THAT THIS WAS A PRODUCT DEFECT THAT CAUSED THE ACCIDENT.  WHILE TAKING UP THE ISSUE WITH BF GOODRICH THEY ADVISED ME TO TAKE THE TIRE IN TO BE INSPECTED.  THE TIRE STORE STATED AFTER ABOUT 10 SECONDS OF LOOKING AT THE TIRE THAT IT WAS CAUSED BY A ROAD HAZARD.  I DID NOT HIT ANYTHING AT ALL DURING THIS 4 HOUR TRIP THAT I WAS JUST ON AND THE TIRE WAS INFLATED AT 35 PSI.  BF GOODRICH DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE ACCIDENT OR MY INJURIES.  THEY DID OFFER ME 30% OFF A NEW TIRE.  TOO BAD I DON'T HAVE A VEHICLE TO PUT A TIRE ON ANYMORE.  I CHECKED THE AIR PRESSURE PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE TRIP FROM SAN DIEGO TO PHOENIX.  I ALSO FILLED UP WITH GAS AND WALKED AROUND THE JEEP, TO WASH THE WINDOWS, AND DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE TIRES.  THE ROAD THAT I WAS TRAVELING ON WAS WELL MAINTAINED AND FREE FROM OBJECTS.  I DID NOT RUN OVER ANYTHING.  I DO HAVE CUSTODY OF THE BAD TIRE STILL ON THE RIM AND PLENTY OF PICTURES OF THE TIRE AND THE VEHICLE AFTER THE ACCIDENT.  IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE TIRE FAILURE CAUSED THE ACCIDENT.  ONE PERSON SAID THAT THE TIRE LOOKED ALMOST LIKE IT WAS RE-TREADED.  *KB",

THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED - I PURCHASED THE JEEP IN ST. AUGUSTINE, FL IN JAN., 2011 & I HAD TO GET GAS RIGHT AFTER PURCHASING IT. THE FIRST TIME I HAD THE AUTO SHUT-OFF ON THE GAS FILLER - IT CLICKED OFF & GAS STARTED FLOWING BACK OUT OF THE TANK. AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT THE GAS FILLER NOZZLE WAS DEFECTIVE, & NOTIFIED THE CONVENIENCE STORE ABOUT THE OVERFLOW - I ASKED FOR SOME \"DRY AGENT\" TO CAPTURE THE GAS THAT HAD SPILLED OVER. THE ATTENDANT SHUT THE PUMP STATION DOWN, & SAID THEY WOULD CALL SOMEONE TO CHECK OUT THE FILLER NOZZLE. THE NEXT TIME THAT I NEEDED GAS (BACK IN ORLANDO, FL) THE JEEP WAS BACK NEAR EMPTY (FUEL LIGHT \"ON\"). I USED THE AUTO CLICK-OFF ON THE FILLER - SAME[XXX], DIFFERENT DAY! I HEARD THE \"CLICK\" OF THE AUTO-SHUT OFF & WITHIN A SECOND, GAS WAS POURING BACK OUT OF THE FUEL NECK OF THE JEEP. PEOPLE WHO WERE PUMPING THEIR OWN GAS HEARD THE FUEL COME OUT OF THE TANK (AND HEARD ME CURSE, LOL!) THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY SAW. I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH FUEL POURED BACK OUT OF THE FUEL NECK OF THE JEEP (AND THE TANK FOR THAT MATTER), BUT THERE WAS A POOL OF FUEL ON THE GROUND. I NOTIFIED THE FUEL ATTENDANT OF THE SITUATION & THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY DRY-SORB CHEMICAL TO ABSORB THE FUEL. I USED PAPER TOWELS TO CLEAN IT UP. NOW I HAVE TO RESORT TO FILL THE JEEP WITH NO MORE THAN 12 GALLONS (NO MORE SHAKING OR THE FUEL MAY COME BACK OUT). I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE INTERNAL VALVE IS DEFECTIVE OR THAT THE USE OF ETHANOL IN THE JEEP HAS DESTROYED THE INTERNAL VALVE. I DON'T GIVE A [XXX] WHAT HAS CAUSED IT - THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF JEEPS THAT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM - DO YOUR JOB NHTSA.GOV!!!

THE REPLACEMENT OF THE DRIVE GEAR DID NOTHING TO ELIMINATE THE CHIRPING. THERE WAS SOME WEAR ON THE DRIVE GEAR WHEN IT WAS REPLACED. A SEARCH ON JEEPFORUM.COM INDICATES THE PROBLEM WITH THE OPDA IS A BUSHING THAT ISN'T GETTING OIL, DUE TO A SEAL THAT IS BLOCKING OIL FLOW.

CHRYSLER  RELEASED A SERVICE BULLETIN (E05) REFERENCE THIS ISSUE, BUT REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE OPDA IS OF FAULTY DESIGN AND CONTINUES TO SUPPLY FAULTY OPDA'S WHEN A REPLACEMENT IS IN FACT SUPPLIED. A RECALL SHOULD BE IN PLACE, BUT IS NOT.

THERE WAS A RECALL (EO5) FOR THE 2005 MODEL YEAR BUT YET THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS IN THE 2006 MODEL AS EVIDENCED BY THE THREAD (THERE ARE OTHER THREADS AND RESEARCH) AS WELL AS THE NATIONAL BACK ORDER FOR THE PARTS SUPPORTING THIS PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM IS THE TEETH ON THE ASSOCIATED GEARS FOR THE SYNCHRONIZER AND THE CAMSHAFT PARTS PREMATURELY WEAR OUT CAUSING PLAY BETWEEN THESE TWO GEARS THUS ACTIVATING THE SENSOR WHICH THEN CAUSES THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT TO BE ILLUMINATED. THIS CEL ACTIVITY LIMITS THE MAXIMUM RPMS AT ~3,000 THUS CAUSING LIMITED DRIVABILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, IF WHEN EXCEEDING THIS RPM LIMIT DUE TO CHANGING GEARS TO EITHER ACCELERATE OR DECELERATE, THE VEHICLE SPUTTERS AND HESITATES SIGNIFICANTLY THUS REDUCING DRIVABILITY POTENTIALLY ENDANGERING THE OCCUPANTS DURING NORMAL CITY AND INTERSTATE DRIVING CONDITIONS. FURTHER USE OF THE VEHICLE CAUSES FURTHER FAILURE OF THESE GEARS RESULTING IN A SHUT DOWN OF THE VEHICLE AND COMPLETE INOPERABLE. WHEN THE GEARS STOP TURNING, THIS ACTION STOPS TURNING THE OIL PUMP RESULTING IN NO OIL FLOW. NO OIL FLOW COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE THE ENGINE TO SEIZE SHOULD THESE GEARS FAIL WHILE DRIVING ON OUR INTERSTATE SYSTEM. *TR",

ALSO WHEN TRAVELING TO NJ, THE GAS ATTENDANTS ARE FULL SERVE ONLY BY LAW, AND THEY COMPLAIN TO ME EVERY TIME I NEED TO GET GAS IN NJ. IT SPITS GAS ALL OVER THE ATTENDANT.    THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE, I GET GAS ON MY SKIN ALMOST EVERY TIME I'M REFUELING THE JEEP.  CHRYSLER/JEEP NEEDS TO DO A RECALL. THERE ARE THOUSANDS+  OF THESE COMPLAINTS. *TR",

SEVERAL DAYS AGO MY WIFE, WHO WAS UNAWARE OF THE PROBLEM, DROVE MY JEEP AND AS A KIND GESTURE THOUGHT SHE WOULD FILL IT UP FOR ME. AS A RESULT, SHE ENDED UP GETTING GAS SPLASHED ON TO HER CLOTHES, THE JEEP, AND THE SURROUNDING GROUND.  THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED PROBLEM. I HAVE COME TO LEARN THAT MANY JEEP WRANGLER OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM. JEEP HAS IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM AS BEING A STUCK CHECK BALL THAT IS CAUSING THE PROBLEM. TO REMEDY THE SITUATION, THEY RECOMMEND THAT YOU BUY A NEW GAST TANK. HOWEVER, NO CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE NEW GAS TANKS, SO IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE YOU WOULD START TO EXPERIENCE THE SAME PROBLEMS AGAIN.

I AM *NOT* ATTEMPTING TO 'TOP OFF' MY FUEL TANK, THIS OCCURS IN THE NORMAL PROCESS OF FILLING MY TANK UP.  TODAY'S INCIDENT (12/23/2009) IS THE THIRD INCIDENT IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS.  PREVIOUSLY, I HAD THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS IT WAS ME EXCEEDING THE FILL LIMIT OF THE TANK ('TOPPING OFF') BECAUSE I  WAS USING THE 'AUTO FILL' SWITCH ON THE GAS NOZZLES HANDLE.  HOWEVER, AFTER THE SECOND INCIDENT IN TWO MONTHS I DECIDED TO DO SOME RESEARCH ONLINE AND HAVE FOUND THAT THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMPLAINT WITH LATER MODEL JEEP VEHICLES.  TO THIS DATE AND TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, HOWEVER, CHRYSLER HAS NOT ISSUED ANY RECALL OR WARNING CONCERNING THIS SAFETY ISSUE.    I AM FILING THIS COMPLAINT BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY HAZARD INVOLVED WITH THE SPLASH BACK OF FUEL WHICH CAN HIT THE PERSON FILLING UP THE TANK; AND BECAUSE THE SPLASH BACK COVERS THE REAR CORNER PANEL OF THE JEEP AFTER IT HAPPENS, LEADING TO A FIRE HAZARD TO THE VEHICLE.    I HAVE NOT YET CONTACTED CHRYSLER, BUT I WILL BE DOING THAT TODAY AS WELL. *TR",

THE LATEST INCIDENT INVOLVING MY JEEP AND GOODYEAR TIRES TRANSPIRED TWO DAYS AGO. I NOTICED THE TIRE WAS LOSING AIR BEFORE I GOT BEHIND THE WHEEL. CONSIDERING I WAS ABOUT TO DRIVE ON A HIGHWAY, IT MAY HAVE BEEN RECIPE FOR DISASTER. I PUT AIR BACK INTO THE TIRE AND WAS ABLE TO DRIVE TO A SEARS AUTOMOTIVE CENTER. THE MECHANICS INFORMED ME THAT THE TIRE HAD A \"SIDEWALL FAILURE\" AND WAS UNFIXABLE. SEARS DID STATE THAT THE TIRES HAD LITTLE TO NO WEAR ON THEM AND WERE \"LIKE NEW\". I CONTACTED GOODYEAR PERTAINING TO THE ISSUES. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE WAS NOT ENTIRELY HELPFUL. I GAVE MY HISTORY WITH THE GOODYEAR TIRES AND THE JEEP WRANGLER TO GOODYEAR. I WAS TOLD TO SEEK A SECOND OPINION BY GOODYEAR. I HAD ANOTHER GOODYEAR RETAILER LOOK AT THE TIRE WITH THE SAME RESULT. I CONTACTED GOODYEAR AGAIN. GOODYEAR WAS QUITE UNHELPFUL AND I FELT \"BLOWN OFF\". I SINCERELY HAVE A CONCERN THAT EVERY TIME I GET IN MY JEEP ONE OF MY TIRES MAY BECOME DAMAGED. JEEP WRANGLERS ARE AN SUV, SO THE CHANCES OF ROLLOVER ARE HIGHER. THE FIRST TIRE THAT WENT ON MY CURRENT 2006 JEEP WRANGLER ALMOST CASED ME TO SPIN OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUSY INTERSECTION. THAT INCIDENT TRANSPIRED IN SEPTEMBER OF 2006. I AM HOPING THAT THIS COMPLAINT WILL INSPIRE SOME SORT OF INVESTIGATION INTO THE PRODUCT, GOODYEAR DID NOT SEEM INTERESTED IN DOING SO. EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK THERE ARE JEEP WRANGLERS ON THE ROAD, MANY OF THEM WITH THESE SAME GOODYEAR GS-A TIRES. THAT IS A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE POTENTIALLY AT RISK, ALONG WITH THOSE WHO MAY BE TRAVELING AT THE SAME TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, I HONESTLY HOPE THIS CAN BE ADDRESSED AND APPROACHED FOR THE POTENTIALLY SERIOUS MANNER THAT IT IS.  *TR",
