There were no obvious signs of leaks but we went and got some coolant and I put about 1/4 gallon of coolant in as it was low. I had the car towed to the dealership.      The service advisor informed me that the issue was related to TSB 07-001-22 REV. B. They had to tighten the bolts connecting the inlet tube. As I searched on some Jeep Forums, I discovered that this issue was addressed with CSN ZD8, however, it's only applicable to certain VINs within 2021-2022. When I mentioned this to the advisor, she said my car wasn't affected by the recall. Clearly, this is a broader issue than just the VINs noted in the recall since this exact issue happened to my vehicle.      I reached out to FCA and was assigned a case manager. After speaking with her, she informed me that she just talked with the dealership possibly providing cost assistance with the matter. I don't know why they're putting it back on the dealership when it's clearly a manufacturing defect. The dealership covered about 1/2 of the cost.

There were people everywhere and I didn\u2019t want anyone to get hurt so I had no choice but to drive the vehicle towards a yellow pole which did stop the vehicle but I have been told after the car was towed to a shop that there is an error code B22A9 and believe it was caused by some ecu failure of some sort.

It is a 2021 Jeep Wrangler 4xe and I am aware of issues being reported with the battery but nothing for this problem except for other mentions on the internet on owners having similar problems intermittently. The jeep will be towed to Pohanka Jeep in Salisbury Md.  There wasn\u2019t any warning lights. I give permission for the vehicle to be inspected at anytime. I feel this vehicle is a danger to the public safety being it was just serviced and inspected by a Jeep dealership 2 weeks prior and the brakes suddenly fall and now there\u2019s a code with something to do with an ecu or electronics having to do with the brakes failing. Could have been killed in the accident or seriously hurt if I hadn\u2019t exited off the road and used the pole to stop the vehicle.

The Jeep may drift into the intersection or oncoming traffic without motive force.  After a period of time, the gas engine will engage.  I estimate the delay to be about 30 seconds.  I often depress the accelerator multiple times before the gas engine engages.   This is extremely dangerous as the vehicle drifts into an intersection, and could potentially be hit by oncoming traffic.  The vehicle shows an engine light identified as a voltage inconsistency in the main battery.  It appears the entire electrical motive system is shut down, but the computer is still calling on it to operate.  When it does not operate, the gas engine will start, but there is a significant and extremely dangerous delay.

It appears the sunlight from the setting sun triggered my adaptive cruise control and forward collision alert and triggered an alarm sound and activated emergency braking at the same time. I have had two previous incidents like this. One at the exact same location on my commute home at around the same time and maybe a week before.  A third occurrence was on an Eastbound morning drive with the rising sun. All three incidents triggered emergency braking from a speed of ca. 65mph. I was able to react fast enough to deactivate the ACC by lightly pushing the brake pedal and could avoid serving or complete stopping of the vehicle. Luckily during all incidents I had no close traffic behind me, otherwise the incidents could have caused a rear end collision.",

I purchase a hybrid that I'm not able to use as a hybrid. Finally, got the repair in the spring. Literally, two months later, it starts doing all kinds of dangerous things.

All was well until 2 weeks ago when it got \"jeep death wobble\", violently shaking back and forth at about 60mph. They did repair it but informed us that there is ANOTHER RISK FOR FIRE RECALL, do not charge it or park in garage, etc. etc. I have a vehicle that is a risk for BURNING MY HOUSE DOWN, this is multiple times and unacceptable.

        "summary": "I would like to express a concern with how Jeep is handing the issue with the hybrid batteries in the Wrangler 4XE. I'm connected with the 4XE across the US and Canada and I am seeing issues with how they are addressing the potential for fires in the batteries.  In my case, my Jeep was initially part of the B9A recall but was removed from the list. I was on the 04B recall list and had that update performed. A few months later, my battery triggered the P0BBD code that indicated that I needed a new battery. We have seen this trend in the 4XE community where someone who wasn't on the B9A list ended up having a battery issue. Some of these instances include Jeeps that were on the 04B list but had yet to receive that update because Jeep communicated that it was a \"defrost\" recall without telling customers that they were receiving the same updates that were included in the B9A. So some people are putting off a very important recall because they believe it is just a defrost recall.  After I had my battery replaced, the latest 95B recall was issued. My Jeep is on this recall list even though I just had a new battery installed. It would sure seem like the issue with the separators in the battery would have already been known when my new battery was installed. To me, that is an unsafe mishandling of the situation to put a known faulty battery in during a replacement.  I do not feel that Jeep is handing these battery issues well and I believe they need some sort of accountability in place to make sure they are truly resolving the issue and not putting band aids on a major issue. We have tracked some data in the 4XE community and are aware that way more batteries were impacted than Jeep announced would be. As well, many batteries have had to be replaced after the recall. This tell me that either Jeep isn't being very forthcoming with the data or they just don't know the correct method for addressing this matter.  We need something done before someone gets hurt or killed.",

The front suspension is the system that failed. My safety was at risk when the vehicle was shaiking and went off the road.  The safety of other drivers was at risk when I had to slow down to under 30 MPH to get my vehicle to stop shaking. The vehicle was taken to a Jeep dealership for inspection/repair but they would not diagnose the problem without me pre-paying a $250 fee.

I am writing this not just for my self but everyone else that is at risk and don't even know about this. I hope someone really looks into this problem .

This issue was random, we took it to the dealership and they drove it for a week until it left them on the side of the road. They kept it for just over a month and a star case had to be opened.  2. 2nd issue, The vehicle would shutter when accelerating and would shutter when braking. Extremely dangerous when trying to drive it back to the dealership. It had something to do with the vehicle not knowing if it wanted to be in electric or gas. this also caused the ac to stop working and the blind spot system not to work .

The jeep was less than 2 years old and had less than 20,000 miles; all stock, never lifted and not used for offroad. I  took the Jeep to the Gilbert AZ Jeep dealership who determined it was the steering stabilizer and replaced it. This week, in July 2024 the death wobble returned on the freeway going full freeway speed and I struggled to maintain control of the vehicle. I contacted the Jeep dealership and they said I could pay $200 to diagnose and if it was the steering stabilizer again all they could do was put a new one on. If it was anything else they would not cover as the jeep was 5 months out of warranty - but has only 29,000 miles on it. His suggestion was to buy an aftermarket part. He said this part fails frequently. This is unacceptable! Why has this part not been recalled or remade?? This is going to result in a violent accident or death.",

I began traveling forward and the rear wheels alternated locking up. I started backing up to move to a safe position, the brake pedal became hard and I was unable to stop causing my vehicle to collide with a wall, speed was below 5 miles an hour but still caused damage to my left rear quarter panel and fiberglass top. After we assessed the damage, I put the vehicle in 2 Wheel Dr., disconnected the battery for 30 minutes, and was able to drive the vehicle to a parking lot in 2 Wheel Dr. After this point and not having phone service, use a satellite communicator to call a local off-road recovery nonprofit that I volunteer for, they were able to assist in bringing a trailer out to tow my vehicle home as it is unsafe to drive and my children were with me.

I brushed off the incident and considered it as normal wear and tear. Then in April 2024 the passenger sun visor broke off. I was on the interstate driving 70mph. I seldom carry passengers and when I do it's mostly after sunset. In both cases, we simply flipped visor down and it broke off. The roads were smooth both times. I went online to search for recalls but instead found many forums experiencing the same issue and suggesting to buy a 3rd party sun visor repair kit.",

This is a significant risk to me because I take this vehicle on off road trails with features require frequent and sometimes prolonged use of the clutch.   The manufacturer, Stellantis/FCA, has exceeded a reasonable amount of time for the recall remedy  What's incredible to me is that in July 2015 NHTSA issued a consent order because FCA was failing to address over 20 recalls in a reasonable amount of time, and here they are doing the same thing!",

These vehicles need to be pulled off of the road or Jeep needs to be forced to get the parts ASAP.  The local dealership said they have several Jeep Wraglers waiting on this part.

Customers are advised to refrain from recharging these vehicles and not to park them inside of buildings or structures, or near other vehicles until the vehicle has the final repair completed.\"  First: I live in Philadelphia and DO NOT have the ability to park away from structures, buildings or other vehicles.  The jeep 4xe is capable of lighting on fire at ANY POINT and there is nothing I can do to reduce my risk.  The recall has been made public since Nov 22,2023 and there is still no lead on a fix nearly 3 months later.  Second: These are plug in hybrid vehicles that are of premium cost for the plug in/electric feature.  Losing the ability to charge them greatly reduces the use and value of the vehicle.   This is by far the worst recall I have ever seen and am dumbfounded that I now sit here nearly 100 days after the recall with no further instruction or lead on a solution.  Jeep should be forced to compensate and provide a reasonable alternative until the solution is established.",

Each time the problem was not correct even though they claimed they replaced a part. I had an independent mechanic (who we trust: this individual services the police car fleet for the department my husband works for). The repair lasted about a year.

However, the most recent recall for the High Voltage Battery B9A/NHTSA 23V-787 is a catastrophic problem because we live in an attached townhome community. This exposes us personally to both catastrophic danger AND liability.  Secondarily, we paid a hefty premium purchase price for a hybrid vehicle, a function that is lost to us now.

It is also extremely challenging to find a place to park the car away from others when driving about town. How does one do that in busy parking lots and parking structures? This would be difficult in any state but far more pronounced in states with cold climates where the vast majority of parking areas are busy and often covered or enclosed.  4.If something catastrophic happened to the Hybrid battery system where the Hybrid system didn't work, you would essentially be stranded. This seems counterintuitive with a separate gas powertrain and separate Hybrid powertrain.  0% is still about 15% general operating condition for the electric assist. There is always some type of regen working to maintain that SOC.  That is unacceptable for a dealership to treat this as it is and not notified the customers when or what could be done.",

I noticed the problem again with the same conditions. I have just over 36,000 miles on the vehicle now. I took it to a Jeep dealer near me since I have moved. The service manager called it a Death Wobble, which seems to be correct. They told me there was no recall, but seems to be a familiar problem with the Jeeps. They installed a new steering damper, balanced and rotated the tires, and checked the front end alignment. I seldom drive the Jeep, but last month I was going to take a trip and while driving on the interstate at approx. 72mph I crossed an expansion joint and it started to wobble so bad that I crossed into the passing lane. It didn't stop until I slowed down to around 50mph. I immediately turned around and coming back it happened again when I was only going 65mph and it through me into the passing lane again. Had to slow down to about 45mph and pull off the road. I have only put about 130 miles on it since it was fixed. I'm waiting for an appointment for the dealer to get it in and check it out. I got underneath the Jeep and checked to make sure the new part didn't come loose or was leaking oil and it seems fine. I don't understand that if this is such a common knowledge problem with the Jeeps and has been for years from my understanding, why hasn't anything been done to address it?",

        "summary": "My Jeep has been sitting in a parking lot at Bald Hill Jeep in Warwick, RI since 12/14, because of two issues, a transmission issue, for which parts have been on back order, and for a a safety recall of the battery, for which there is no solution for repair. This is a safety hazard to myself, others and property in general. The battery may catch fire whether it\u2019s on of off. I will not put safety of myself, others, or property, at risk. I want a full refund of the purchase price of my vehicle so that I can buy a vehicle that is safe to drive.   Even if they fix the transmission issue, the vehicle is unsafe to drive. I have been without a vehicle due to both issues since 12/14/23. I expect Jeep to pay for a rental vehicle until I get my full refund of the purchase price of my vehicle.  Also, I found out about the recall when I went to the dealership after my car engine light went on and my vehicle stalled twice. I only received an official notice of the recall AFTER, as if Jeep is trying to hide the unsafe recall. I scanned the QR code to request a refund, however, there are many technical issues with the form that will not allow me to proceed with the submission. Another issue is that I have tried to contact Jeep via FCA online email form, such also does not work.   It appears they want to avoid being contacted.

The second battery is tiny and considered an auxiliary battery. It is located in a place that I can not get too, and can not check to see if its good or bad. However, as soon as it has any issues it will keep the Jeep from starting up. If you are out in the country or in the middle of nowhere then you will be stranded. It does not matter if the larger battery is working perfectly, the auxiliary battery will disable the entire vehicle anyway. This is a huge safety issue for obvious reasons. According to Jeep forums over the internet, this is a very common issue on all Jeeps with two batteries. It would be nice to take the auxiliary battery out, but Jeep engineered the two batteries to disable the entire vehicle if the auxiliary battery dies. Poor engineering? Perhaps! I would suggest there be a recall and that Jeep be forced to take the auxiliary battery out and re-wire the electrical system to allow vehicles to start regardless of the auxiliary battery. Some customers might want to keep the auxiliary battery cause it plays a part with the auto-start system. I would like to remove the battery and the auto-start all together and still have a functioning vehicle. I don't want to be stranded out in the middle of nowhere where I have no cellphone service.",

The dealer recommended that the steering damper be replaced along with some additional parts. I have mechanical breakdown coverage with Geico and a service plan with Autonation. I also contacted Jeep Cares as the death wobble is a know problem with Jeeps. Jeep Cares would not assist with the repair because I had mechanical breakdown coverage with my auto insurance policy. My mechanical breakdown coverage thru Geico has a $250 deductible which I am responsible for with any repair. Jeep told me that steering damper was on backorder with an ETA of 30-45 days or longer. They then told me that I could pick up my car and drive it as long as I stayed under 50 miles. I told them this option would not work for me because I drive 30 miles to and from work each day. Jeep then told me that they would look for an OEM replacment. The OEM replacment was successful but I had to pay an additional $90 for the part as my mechanical breakdown coverage only covered the cost for the part from Jeep. At the end of the day I am out of $340 plus dollars for a known Jeep issue. Jeep needs to stand behind their problem regardless of mileage. This is a serious problem.",

This could cause inexperienced drivers to panic and wreck or worse yet cause an real accident while they try to asses the situation.  Since the problem has been around so long I'd ask why nothing has been done to correct the issue permanently.  If its due to solid axel, then maybe that needs to be replaced.

It is not corrected!!!  Yesterday, while traveling on I-70 near Virginia at about 70 mph (the speed limit), the Jeep displayed a Jeep Vehicle with the PHEV High Voltage Cables and Battery Pack Diagram drawn over the Jeep in Bright Red color. No codes happened at all when this appeared (no Check Engine Light, no service indicators, nothing).  Some words quickly flashed on the dash display stating something like, \"Loss of Performance\" and the engine shutdown completely and the \"D\" next to shifter binked yellow continuously afterwards. The dash then stated to Shift Vehicle into Park to Restart (while still coasting at nearly 70 mph).  I managed to coast it to the emergency lane, stop the Jeep, shift into park and restart. It then would not run even remotely normal, because it was in a safety mode of some sort. Again, with the engine running completely erratically,  no coding at all. When I pressed the accelerator like normal, it would not respond at all (even putting it to the floor had no affect). I had to figure out how to get the accelerator to work so I could drive it back home.  I had to gently press the pedal to get it to respond and then the Jeep would not go above about 2500 RPM. It would force itself to slow down if it reached any higher RPM.   I went to the local Jeep Dealership ASAP today and was told nothing was recorded in the computer, software is up to date, and there is nothing wrong with my Jeep.   This is a serious problem and has to be diagnosed and fixed!!!!",

I work in emergency surgery and if I don't have a reliable vehicle to respond to emergencies, patients can literally die. That is not hyperbole, its reality.",

He said that this is the 2nd Jeep Wrangler he has seen with the same engine light and code and believes it has something to do with the fuel system.  My Jeep is less than 3 years old and only has 22,556 miles on it. I have only driven it around town and on the highways.

I drive my normal route on the highway and as I am approaching 65 mph, I go over a transition from asphalt to concrete bridge and the car starts to do the death wobble, where a strong vibration from the front end shook the car until I let off the gas and slowed down to about 40mph. my sister-in-law also experienced in her 2020 Jeep, the same day the freeze set in. Ive had steering gearbox changed and two stabilizers replaced already, JEEP TSB once stated: JL JT have unique torque values for ball joints as compared to prior JK models due to material (aluminum knuckles) and design changes. I guarantee its the crappy ball joints and they REFUSE to admit it. Jeep still claims they cant duplicate the issue or i need to replace tires (that are wearing unevenly bc of ball joint issues) befor they can continue diagnosis. 4 different dealerships. 4 different outcomes. even [XXX]  from their corporate office stopped responding to me.

The two vertical welds failed with the remaining welds being at the top of the spring perch.  The only indications of a problem were an occasional knocking sound when going over a bump and severe vibration coming from the rear of the vehicle. The noise was caused by the spring perch flexing and tapping the bottom of the body.  I believe the welds broke early this year but the source of the noise wasn't found until July 2023.  With prolonged use in this condition the spring perch can completely fail causing the spring and perch to fall out and make the driver lose control.  The dealership submitted pictures and the manufacturer has agreed to replace the entire frame.  There are a handful of other people that have reported the same problem (always on the passenger rear) but because of the design, I suspect as these vehicles age stress fractures in the weld will make this issue more prevalent.",

        "summary": "The Air Conditioner in my 2021 Jeep Wrangler with 15K miles  caused two anaphylactic reactions to mold. On Wednesday May 31, 2023, immediately upon starting the Jeep engine and the AC fan starting I had a severe allergic reaction while driving that resulted in me having to pull over and administer my EPI pen and use my inhaler. At the time my soft top was off as were the windows and doors.  On Sunday, June 1st, the next time I got into my Jeep to drive the same thing happened. This time the doors/windows and soft top were attached. The the only constant variables to the allergic reactions were my Jeep and running the air conditioning. Today ran my Jeep engine in my driveway (it is currently 83 degrees in St. Louis) and ran the air conditioner for 30 minutes and there was NO fluid under the Jeep from condensation from the AC running. I believe the AC condensate line is clogged, and that there is mold on the AC evaporator, both causing my entire AC system and entire vehicle to be contaminated with mold causing both my anaphylactic reactions. The mold allergy is life threatening to me. The mold is also life threatening to the general public if I am driving and unable to maintain control of the vehicle due to anaphylaxis caused by the mold in the vehicle and AC system. The risk I would need to assume, if I choose to drive the Jeep again is unacceptable - and I will not take that risk. Additionally, I will not cause or assume liability for any harm caused to the public that results from an anaphylactic reaction of increasing severity to mold while driving the Jeep, which would likely temporarily incapacitate me and render me unable to control the Jeep. I will not drive my Jeep until both issues have been repaired and the Jeep has had a mold inspection and appropriate mold remediation. The Jeep dealership cannot service the Jeep for over 30 days rendering me without a car.",

I brought it to the dealership who couldn't replicate the problem because their techs could not drive 70mph. Talked with jeep wave and opened a case with them and they advised to bring to a different dealer. Brought to new dealer who drove the vehicle and experienced the violent shaking. They removed the damper and reinstalled. A week later the issue has returned and another appointment has been made.  While traveling on the interstate this happened 7 times in 1 two hour trip. I had to pull over to the shoulder in traffic that many times which puts everyone in danger.  Jeep keeps claiming it's the steering damper that is the issue but even after replacing with the newest version this still happens.  It is very scary to have it happen randomly and puts everyone at risk at those speeds.  I was able to film it happening and have that video readily available.

It was a dangerous situation trying to move to the side of the highway with no power nor power steering. Once on the side, multiple warning lights were on and vehicle would not start but control lights remained on. I called the dealership/service department of South Point Dodge and their recommendation was to disconnect the battery connection to reset. I was driving from Houston so I was desperate to get the car to start as my family was waiting outside of the car on the highway as well. I reconnected battery terminal and was able to restart the vehicle. At around 12k miles, I started experiencing extreme Jeep Wobble  aka 'Death Wobble.' This occurred often while doing speed limit between 55-65 mph/higher on the highway and if vehicle hit a bump. The only way to stop the shaking was to slow down by braking to approximately 35-40 mph. In 02/2023, dealer changed out the 'dampners' and did update for electrical recall. On 03/14/2023, at approx 23k miles, the vehicle again lost complete power, would not restart and multiple warning lights came on. Control panel reported Electronic Stability Control Issue, Fuel Door Open when it physically was not, Vehicle in Drive while physically in park. Vehicle would not restart. Disconnected the battery terminal but this did not correct the issue. Vehicle was manually put into neutral to put onto tow truck. This vehicle has caused several life threatening concerns. Despite the recall fixes, the same issues continue to be present and long term solution is not available at this time.

During this call I made an appointment with JEEP for the issue to be fixed on February 24, 2023.   On Wednesday, February 22, 2023, two days before my scheduled appointment, the engine of my Jeep failed ~6PM while I was driving on highway 495S near Merrimac, MA (mile 114.8). I was in the far left lane traveling at about 70 mph and lost all power steering, power brakes, everything. The engine completely lost power without warning. No messages, warning lights or other signs of any issue before a total loss of power.   Thankfully, I was able to drift from the left lane, crossing 2 lanes of traffic on a busy highway, to reach the shoulder on the other side of the highway. I did this in the dark without without power brakes and without power steering. I was with my 2 year old son and am grateful that we are both still alive. A loss of engine power at that speed on a busy highway could easily have caused an accident, perhaps fatal for ourselves or others.   After 2 hours stranded on the shoulder of the road, the Jeep was towed by AAA to the Jeep dealership nearest to where I lost power, Bill Deluca Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram in Haverhill, MA. It has been sitting in the parking lot of that dealership now for 6 days and they claim to be too busy to investigate the issue or perform a recall fix.  The service repair shop at this dealership has been wholly uncooperative and unhelpful.  I have called the manufacturer and am currently awaiting a service appointment at another Jeep dealership. According to Jeep/Chrysler, I am responsible for the out of pocket cost of the tow from the Jeep dealership in Haverhill to the Jeep dealership in Lynnfield. This seems absurd as the faulty vehicle is the reason I am unable to drive it from one dealership to the next. In the meantime, I have now been renting a car for 6 days, paying out of pocket.",

I was able to slow down and the wobble went away but my anxiety did not go away. It happened about 4 more times that day on the interstate. I was traveling and concerned about my safety and that of others. I was also concerned about what was happening with my Jeep, how could I fix it, COULD it be fixed, and how was I going to pay for it.  I thought the front end of my Jeep needed to be re-aligned so I took it to the dealership I bought it from, they inspected it and said it did not alignment. Said the Jeep had developed a \"wobble.\" I was told that parts to fix this issue were not available in the U.S. and they had no ETA on when/if a part would be available. They took my phone number and said they would call if something changed. Now I have a Jeep that I am afraid of - actually terrified of.

        "summary": "We purchased our Jeep brand new in January 2021.  Tire Details:  Bridgestone Dueler A/T, Size 255/70R18, Load Index:  133T, Speed Rating:  M+S, DOT/Tire ID#:  93XJ RHF 4820.   In November 2022, we experienced a catastrophic sidewall blowout of the passenger side front tire while driving 75-80 mph in the high speed lane on I-75.  We were instantly warned by the dashboard automatic tire pressure monitoring system.  The tire pressure dropped from normal to zero in a matter of 100 yards.  This warning saved our lives. To this day, I still don\u2019t know how we got the Jeep safely over to the emergency lane on the right side of I-75 during high traffic.  Key point to note \u2013 we only had approximately 30,000 miles on our tires at the time of the incident. We called Florida\u2019s Road Rangers who put our spare tire on the vehicle.  When we got to our destination, we took it to the Okeechobee Jeep Dealer.  The Service Manager and Mechanic both said they had never seen a sidewall blown out like this tire.  They recommended we contact Bridgestone to notify them of a safety complaint and possible monetary credit. At their recommendation we took detailed pictures of the blown tire.  The Dealer pitched the blown tire as we had a car full of luggage.   We purchased a new Bridgestone tire from this Jeep Dealer at that time as we did not want to ride around with no spare.  We were not sure of the integrity of the remaining 3 tires.   We contacted Bridgestone, Ref # 1387342.  After talking to a series of Reps, they seemed indifferent about this unsafe event and said they could do nothing on the tire warranty since we did not go to an authorized Bridgestone dealer.  A Rep said if we had the original tire they would warranty it, but the pictures would not suffice!   I came away with the sense that Bridgestone does not have any concern about their tire safety. They never asked for the pictures or the DOT/Tire Identification number. They did not stand behind their tires from a warranty aspect.",

        "summary": "I have a 2021 Sahara Wranger with only 11,000 miles and is only 16mths old, all stock. On November 11, 2021 is the first time experiencing the so called death wobble. I hit a divot from a recessed reflector that lines the yellow lines in the road. I was going only 55 when I only drove over two, when suddenly my steering wheel and while Jeep started shaking violently. I let my foot off the accelerator , letting the Jeep slow down to under 50 when it finally stopped. It was very frightening to me and my daughter and called the dealership immediately to report the issue and was very nervous to drive it again. After inspection at the dealership I was told they couldn\u2019t find a problem so I took off feeling maybe it was just a freak thing. But then a month later the same thing happened, but this time I was coming down a steep grade around 60mph  when there was a small divot that I ran over and again the steering wheel shacking violently and the whole Jeep shaking worse then the first time. I tried not to break and let my foot off the accelerator again, but this time the Jeep wouldn\u2019t slow down by its self because I was going down hill. I thought I was going to loose control of the vehicle and crash. Shaking, I pulled over and called the dealership immediately. I told them I was afraid to drive the vehicle and I wanted it taken care of immediately. I had to have my husband drive it to the dealership for me, because I was to scared. After hours and hours or research on the internet, I don\u2019t understand why this hasn\u2019t been recalled. It is a serious safety issue and needs to be addressed. My Jeep has now been in the shop for three days, and I have not been given and information on what they are doing about it. I have read many many articles on how the dealership will just use a bandaid to fix it and it will happen again. I\u2019m not sure if I can feel safe ever driving it again. This is a band new vehicle and everyone with this 2021 model should be contacted and told about this",

The car was unmanagable when travelling at a speed over 58 and hitting uneven paving - the shudder took over the entire car and steering.  There was no recourse but to try to safely pull over and stop the car.  Upon research I found this is a now COMMON OCCURENCE called the DEATH WOBBLE.  Generally it happens in modified Jeeps however my car is les than two years old with less than 16,000 miles on it.  When I could finally get time at the dealership I was met with, oh yes we had five new jeeps in here just last week with this condition we are seeing it all the time.  The part that is supposed to provide remedy is back ordered by at least three weeks - is this as there as so many incidents?.  The dealership told me to take my car home until they had a part.  The car is NOT SAFE to drive at any accelerated speed with this condition.  There was no prior warning of this condition and nor would I expect it in a new vehicle but upon research I am learning how many people are experiencing this and questioning why there has not yet been a recall.  The part offered as remedy by the dealership - the steering damper - has been identified as a \"band aid\" - and that it is likely the condition will re-occur.  This is not acceptable or safe for any new Jeep owner (or any Jeep owner)  I urge, no I BEG you, to investigate this \"death wobble\" condition and strongly consider a recall for the manufacturer before there are serious injuries and deaths caused by this.  Having personally experienced this it is a terrifying experience - the entire car feels like it is out of control and everything is going to fall off including the tires and that the axle will break - it makes me never want to drive that car again with any degree of confidence and feeling of safety.  I urge you to just google DEATH WOBBLE.  Please help",

I have to step on the brake slow the vehicle down to stop the shaking then I can accelerate.  I made an appt to get the vehicle serviced on 11/16/22 that is when I was told the Steering Damper was faulty the dealership had to order the part with no estimated time of delivery.  On 12/1/22 the steering damper was replaced.  The dealership told me this can happen again.  This vehicle is new I have never taken it off-roading, I have only driven it on the roads and freeways.   Why would Jeep Chrysler continue to sell Jeeps knowing this issue is happening.  Driving on the freeway and braking to stop the vehicle from shaking is extremely dangerous.   After extensive research its called the Death Wobble.  This is gross negligence from Chrysler to knowingly sell a vehicle that has a reputation of having a death wobble and putting people's lives in danger.  I want to know what my options are.",

        "summary": "Since purchase of the vehicle the steering has had a \"wobble\" after hitting a bump (bridge transition on interstate is most common).  The wobble occurs at higher speeds 60-75 mph.  The wobble has gotten worse and I would now classify it as the \"death wobble\" that is commonly reported on the internet forums.  It literally shakes the wheel (and front end) so violently that you have to slow down to 40-45 mph to make it stop.  It is unsafe to have to brake this hard on a high speed road to stop the vibration of the vehicle.  The vibration is violent and observable from outside the vehicle as a trailing vehicle informed me.  Also, a young or inexperienced driver may not make the proper decision to address the violent wobble.  I have had the vehicle inspected by a local Jeep dealer and they plan to order a new steering stabilizer (amazingly backordered with no committed delivery date).  My concern is whether this is a repair or a band-aid.  Will this continue to happen?  This vehicle had the issue from purchase and it got extremely violent within 22,000 miles.  Will I need to take it to the shop for a new stabilizer every 20,000 miles?  Would like some facts on what the root cause is and how the stabilizer will permanently fix the issue.  Also, why is this not a recall?",

After several visits to the dealership I was told they knew what was wrong that it was something about steering calibration. but they had no way to correct the problem because Jeep had not provided a mechanism for a fix. The best I can describe the steering problem is that there seems to be excessive steering wheel play, and wandering/drifting of the vehicle while driving requiring constant left to right and then right to left steering to keep the vehicle going straight in its traffic lane.  The vehicle only has 3,000 miles driven. I am hesitant to drive on any expressway because of the unstable steering.",

Classic \"higher speed\" \"possibly turn on a highway\" and maybe the bumps of a bad road or a bridge transition and the front end shimmy's nearly uncontrollably.  Was on the way to the dealership to get an oil change already.  Asked them about it, he said it'd be nearly a month to get it diagnosed.  Did some research, apparently this is an ongoing issue that is getting reported to Chrysler and the NHTSA already with possible \"fixes\" being replacement dampeners or a new steering box.  I don't know what Chrysler will do at this time as the diagnosis date is in the future but... a replacement dampener seems to only bandaid the issue.  The real issue is some other fault that wears the dampener down early.  Replacing it or upgrading it only hides the fault.  I believe they are making progress with the idea that the aluminum steering box stretches and needs to be steel but can't say 100%.  What I do know is it's scary as hell when it happens and given that the jeep is already prone to a short wheelbase and higher center of gravity, any high speed steering uncontrollability should be considered critical and not \"slowly looked at\".",

Around mile marker 60-61 I started having difficulty keeping the RPM's up and my speed up to the speed limit. shortly after I heard a banging/clunking noise and I got off the highway. My Jeep was towed to Monroeville Jeep. Monroeville Jeep called the next day 6/23/2022 and said that the clutch plate overheated, fragmented and destroyed the transmission and it is not covered under warranty since the transmission did not fail. I had previously taken my Jeep in to Diehl Automotive on 7/19/2021 for recall #Y07/NHTSA 21V-028 to have the recall done. What happened to my Jeep on 6/22/2022 is exactly what the recall said would happen if I did not have the recall work done. In the weeks prior to 6/22/2022 I did notice the RPM's acting erratically but not being a mechanic I had no clue what was going on. other than that, there was no warning signs. There is now at least 30 other Jeep owners who had the recall done, some had both recalls done and the recalls failed to prevent the clutch plate from overheating, fragmenting and destroying the transmission",

This is the fourth time this issue has happened.   Seems to happen every 5 months or so.  The first time they replaced the throttle body.  Second time they replaced it again and had it back for one day and the issue popped up again.  They then said they would replace it but it had to be something else since it was a brand new throttle body.  They ended up replacing the PCM and I was without the Jeep for an entire month.   This time I went in and they said it wasn\u2019t the throttle body.  So they cleared the codes and I went to pick it up, when I turned it on it tells me to service electric throttle body.  I couldn\u2019t even make it out of the dealership parking lot.    When this issue happens.   No matter what speed you are at it literally decreases your speed to 15MPH. Luckily I have never been on the highway when said issue has happened.   It is a serious safety concern.   This last time I had my two children in the car with me, my 2 year old daughter and my 1 year old son.   I do not feel safe, or that this car is reliable.   I have been reading forums about this said issue and I am not the only one having them.   That is where I got the information to come here.   I hope it is something you can look into.

The Jeep app on my phone alerted me that my vehicle could not charge which was strange because I was driving and not charging at all.

The system flashed a 'stabilizer system' warning and immediately lost speed and did not respond to pressure on the gas/e pedal. We turned on the hazards and coasted across several lanes of traffic to the shoulder. After restarting, the dash displayed a check engine light the remainder of the trip, and the engine cut out one more time on the way home in a much slower safer area, thankfully.   This is the second similar/major issue with this vehicle. On March 10, 2022, with only 419 miles on it, the vehicle displayed a charging error message at attempted start, provided no power to the engine, and locked itself in 'Park.' Fortunately, this engine power failure and subsequent shutdown occurred in our driveway rather than at highway speed. The vehicle was at Jeep dealership service from 03/11/22 to 04/04/22 and the issue was escalated to Fiat/Chrysler/Jeep engineers. Jeep engineers recommended six separate updates, none of which were successful. Ultimately, a part was taken from the Jeep assembly line and shipped to the dealership for use in my vehicle.

I am writing this email to complain about my 2021 Wrangler Unlimited (3.6L) Automatic that I Purchased on 28 November 2021 from Trading Enterprises company LLC Al-Futtaim group(sales Office Dubai UAE-DFC). Unfortunately, The Jeep\u2019s problem started on day one drive-by suspecting strange noises coming from the Engine\u2019s side. I requested an appointment at Trading Enterprises Dubai, and the Service Advisor told me the sound is normal (it's a new car, and the noise will go after some time).  In January 2022 I went on a mountain camping trip with my small family in Fujairah city and suddenly the car\u2019s power was cut completely on a steep mountain(Have shared the videos with the TE team showing the front wheels are not spinning). The car was about to roll over and I was embarrassed, frightened, and worried about my family\u2019s safety. I managed to get my family safe out of the car and, with the help of friends, I took the car to a safer place.  On 29/1/2022 (TE Walk Around Inspection) after the test drives, the TE team requested to keep the car for proper checking and after a few days, the Service Advisor informed me that it was a problem with the 4W system, especially considering that 4L was not engaged due to a wiring problem and they had to rectify the issue, I swallow it with pain.  The car is sluggish when accelerating in the first gear and misfires when I depress the gas pedal, I was on a construction site where they have a ramp and suddenly a big truck shows up and so I needed acceleration from the car but it doesn\u2019t respond. The gas pedal was to the maximum and it still doesn\u2019t work, it was a huge close call as I nearly crashed into a truck.   On 13/4/2022 I experienced the same issue on the sand and the highway with extra problems and decided to visit the TE as I can't take this anymore, TE  team requested to keep the car to check the issues.  8 weeks now and the car is still with the dealer",

Then without any warning, the Jeep went into limp mode from 70mph-50mph. With no notice, we were thrown forward due to the sudden decrease in speed. This action caused the vehicles behind us to swerve to avoid collision.  My adaptive cruise control shut itself off and the electronic throttle control warning light started flashing.  My throttle control was weak and unreliable, taking a lot of pedal to respond and then not needing hardly any pedal and would surge forward with sudden speed. It was a very dangerous situation. We continued driving in limp mode as there were no safe locations to stop and we  didn\u2019t have any cell service. Both malfunction lights remained on and we drove straight to our dealer. They said the EGR cooler failed and clogged up all of the EGR system with soot and then burned out the catalytic converter. They were able to clear the soot out of the system and cleared the malfunction lights so we could drive it home as they didn't have any loaners to offer us. The service advisor told us if we had another vehicle we should park the Jeep and not drive it until the parts come in. They have no ETA on either the EGR cooler nor the catalytic converter. I have been in contact with the manufacturer and there has been no progress on sourcing parts, I am looking in to pursuing a lemon law claim as this vehicle is not compliant with any emissions standards and if not repaired will injure us and others. It is available for inspection with notice, as it is parked at my house I would prefer advanced notice of any inspectors arrival. The warning lights are no longer on, but it sounds and runs like crap and even if the parts are replaced I will always worry that it will do it again. We could have been killed.",

        "summary": "The exact cause on my vehicle is currently unknown, but this is definitely a suspension & steering related issue.  There are numerous previous reports of what I have had occur to me \"death wobble\" multiple times now in Jeep Wrangler forums and YouTube online.  We can reproduce with video of the issue.  The Jeep forums indicate that it is usually suspension/trackbar/control bar/bushing/or improperly tightened bolts on these suspension areas.  I have taken to two different dealerships within a two week period who have inspected these components and not found anything abnormal.    The problem occurs when driving at speeds between 45 and 70 mph and driving over a small bump, bridge transition, expansion joint.  The entire vehicle begins to shakes violently, including the steering wheel.  You can only recover by pulling over to side of road to complete stop.  This is extremely dangerous in construction zones, rush hour/high traffic situation.  The vehicle has been inspected by two separate Jeep dealerships.  Both were aware of the problem being experienced occurring on other Jeep Wranglers, known as \"death wobble\".  Neither dealership found a problem in their inspection.  The first dealership could not reproduce on their road test.  After getting car back, we drove approx. 30miles on highway and the problem occurred two times in that distance, both times over bridge transitions.  We then took to second dealership. The second dealership said they did feel something in the steering, but nothing violent or unsafe during their road test.  They are ordering a steering dampener replacement part, but is on back order for 2wks+.  There are no warnings or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure.  My wife and I first started to experience a steering bump at around 20k miles (a couple thousand miles after purchase).",

The dealer has been great at trying to fix the issue but they have admitted that they don't know what it is or how to fix it and are relying on the national Jeep engineers to help try to fix it.  Talking with the mechanics at the dealer they keep saying the national Jeep engineers are just guessing at this point on what the issue is and they don't know what the issue is either.   I am far from the only one that is having this issue.

After much research it was found that there has been litigation for this same issue in at least one other state with multiple plaintiffs where FCA settled and paid out a large sum to consumers. I no longer feel safe driving this vehicle as multiple repairs have been necessary so far and there seems to be no guarantee that it will not happen in the future. A car stalling (this has been reported at as high as 70 miles per hour) during operation is a safety concern for myself and of all others driving on the road. We were informed that this could happen anytime after the check engine light illuminates, or as it turns on in many cases. The fact that there has not been a large scale recall, and that we were not informed of the issue when obtaining the vehicle is a huge safety hazard.",

        "summary": "I have no technical no-how with cars so I will describe as best I can.  We have a brand new 2021 Jeep Wrangler 4xe--bought it one month ago--and two weeks in, while driving, the check engine light came on.  We were out of town so called the local dealer but they could not see us for three weeks.  So we researched the issue and thought it could be a loose gas cap etc.  We did some trouble shooting but nothing changed.  Then, while driving, the entire dash lit up with various warnings, including the hybrid warning, and it just shut down.  We were next to a parking lot and coasted in.  Through a series of actions we were able to get it driving again and made it to another dealership.  When we arrived all signals were gone and they could find no trouble codes to check.  We were able to drive back home and we thought maybe it was the loose gas cap issue.  We would have taken it into the dealership as a precaution, but service appts are weeks out.  And it drove fine for several days.   Then our daughter was driving it on an extremely busy and dangerous road.  Luckily she'd just turned off it into our neighborhood--but she was still driving at a decent speed--and all of a sudden all the warning lights came on again, including the hybrid signal, and the car completely shut down on her.  Stopped mid-drive and mid-road.  We now have had it towed to the dealership.  We have also read all the similar stories now with Jeep 4xes and have serious concerns about the extent of this issue and thus the safety of the vehicle.  The dealership can't look at it for weeks, but we have already contacted sales to see what they can do.  I feel like it could take months to work out what is happening here--especially with service backups--and I do not feel safe with any of our family members doing a back and forth on this until we find out that a serious recall in underway.",

If you look at online forums, _dozens_ of people are having the same problem with this vehicle.  What is even more concerning is that almost every person had a different fix - and many are having this as a repeat problem, with multiple people invoking the lemon law and having Jeep buy the vehicle back.

Numerous error messages were displaying but I did not have time to see them all. Final message I could see was \"Charging System Error\".  After turning the Jeep off then back one the problem cleared.  I suspect this was caused by the Adaptive Cruise Control system.  It had started to brake hard for a car not actually in my lane.  At the same moment people were pulling in behind me to move over for a police car on the shoulder. The Adaptive Cruise Control started what was a hard brake check on this traffic, so I overrode it by pressing on the accelerator, at which point it died.   At the dealer they determined from the codes that the transmission control unit had shut off the engine control unit.  Otherwise nothing could be determined as being wrong with the vehicle.  Seeing all the other complaints of similar incidents involving Wranglers I think there is bad software code in the vehicle's control systems.",

I was unable to move the car, and instead had to put the car in park and turn off the engine. The \"D\" light on the gear shifter was blinking, and then the battery on the car went from 55% charge down to 47% charge. A red lightning bolt emergency sign came on but then went off immediately after. With the car off in the middle of the road, I restarted it hoping for the best. Luckily, it did restart fine and I could continue driving. However, I have heard on Jeep 4xe forums that this is an issue with many other owners, some even happening on the interstates. I am now too afraid to drive this car with my child or for long distances, because this issue was completely spontaneous and unpredictable. I took it to the dealer to be serviced, but they are unsure what is going on. And as a side note, this is a brand new car (2021 year) with 105 miles. I only had it for FIVE days before this happened. Prior to this incident I also noticed that the charge would not hold very long at all - for example, driving it today 3.4 miles from one point to the dealer, the charge went from 47% to 17% - this should not be normal. Overall this issue is unacceptable and this needs to be addressed immediately before people die. Thanks for your consideration.",

This includes the motor and the engine. - The steering is compromised. You cannot steer the vehicle very well during this loss of power. - The vehicle usually will not restart and must be towed in or, in some cases, the battery can be disconnected causing the vehicle to reset and allowing it to begin operating again. This solution can work for a several power cycles or none at all. - When this happens, and you attempt to restart the vehicle sometimes when the power returns you are unable to tell if the vehicle is in neutral, drive, reverse, park, etc.  - I experienced a case where the vehicle was in the Run position and the power windows would not open. When it was in the Off position, the windows would open. Perhaps this is intended behavior.  - The seatbelt light will stay on even though all passengers in the vehicle are buckled in. It is unclear if this is part of the same issue, but it seems to be. - Systems compromised: Steering, braking, power/engine, seatbelts, etc.  Examples of Incidents: - Driving in neighborhood (Safe Location) - Driving at highway speed (Unsafe Occurrence) - Driving on an off-road trail (thankfully with others) (Unsafe Occurrence) - Driving at highway speed - We almost crashed twice trying to get off the hwy.

After some researched I learned there was a technical service bulletin (8-003-21) for the 2018-2020 JL and supposedly the 2021 had the upgraded steering gear and updated software for the electric power steering.  However this really didn't solved the problem and may owners have been complaining about the same unsafe wandering or pulling of the vehicle from left or right.  I have take it to the dealer and also called Chrysler direct, so they can open case number (80562177).  After 30 days at the dealer the outcome was to increase the tow to +.35 from Chrysler's recommended +.20. It is my understanding both +.35 and +.20 are within the manufacture's recommended specifications.  Normally isn't the toe supposed to be near or at zero (0).  It seems that setting the toe to +.35 is a band-aid.  While the wandering and pulling has decreased I fear this is short term solution and it may cause unseen premature failure of other components.",

        "summary": "The actual malfunctioning issue is UNKNOWN. However, my best explanation is as follows: While driving my new 2021 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon (which only has 1400 miles), on the highway at roughly 70 miles per hour and going up a hill, the vehicle felt as if it were trying to up-shift a gear but then immediately down-shift a gear. This up-shift and down-shift feeling continued in quick repetition over and over in a violent shaking manner that thrust the entire vehicle forwards and backwards as long as I continued the acceleration up the hill. Letting off the accelerator seemed to end the violent shaking. I pulled over on to the side of the highway to stop, and turned off the Jeep since the check engine light came on. I waited about five minutes and started up the Jeep again. The check engine light was still on, though. Any acceleration at any speed now causes the Jeep to violently thrust forwards and backwards like I experienced on the highway. I tried to get Jeep Roadside to tow the Jeep to a dealership, but learned how worthless this Jeep Roadside program truly was. Several days after this incident, and I still do not have my Jeep at a dealership for repairs, nor do I have a rental. Jeep Roadside refuses to tow my Jeep to a dealership that has a rental, and I cannot afford to pay the towing fee's to get to a dealership with a rental. The nearest dealerships tell me they are six to eight weeks out on loaner vehicles. I'm too worried to try and driving my Jeep the distance to reach a dealership with a rental, cause it is way too unsafe to operate this Jeep with the violent shaking. I'm curious if anyone else is having this same issue, or knows more.",

Lane changing requires overcorrection due to the wandering. Difficult to hold straight line. Dealer says nothing is wrong and that's how it is and nothing they can do to fix. Dealer states they cannot duplicate. This is a known issue from FCA on previous years and has continued into some 2021 models. Not being able to drive within the lanes poses a hazard to driver, passengers, and other vehicles on the road. Overcorrection due to extreme sensitivity will create a roll over hazard.",

First they reset the computer.  The second time they replaced the 4wd module.  The incorrect status is redisplayed again.  I have only had this jeep for 2 months, it has less than 3000 miles on it.  The dealer doesn't seem to know what the problem is.  I have talked with Jeep corporate who also says they can find no reports of this issue.  However the internet jeep forums are full of people reporting this problem, supposedly it is related to failed axle locker sensors on the Rubicon wranglers.  It is common enough an aftermarket company sells a wiring harness that bypasses the sensor.  Because the sensor is not available separately, eventually this requires the entire axle be replaced.  Some people have had their axles replaced 3-4 times.  There really should be a recall.  More than a few posters have also stated their axles have locked by themselves in 2H.  This could cause a crash as axle lockers are not designed for use on pavement or at high speeds.    Here are some links to the the forums:   https://www.jlwranglerforums.com/forum/threads/%E2%80%9Cservice-axle-locker-system%E2%80%9D-light-on.13241/ https://www.jlwranglerforums.com/forum/threads/what-happens-when-the-axle-lock-sensor-fails.67068/ https://www.jlwranglerforums.com/forum/threads/random-service-axle-locker-system.35153/ https://www.jlwranglerforums.com/forum/threads/jl-rubicon-owners-keep-your-locker-sensors-from-failing-how-to-pot-your-sensors.56892/  Here is a link to the wiring harness sold because it is such a common problem https://www.zautomotive.com/product/z_lkr_oem/ The attached photo shows the car in 2H, the lock symbol over the axle, driving 70mph",

It would not move any further. The shifter was frozen in Park. Lights and warnings were illuminated on the dash that were not on before this happened. We were in a wilderness and had no cell reception whatsoever. It would not start, drive or otherwise move. Eventually someone came by and took us into a small town where we called the dealer for assistance. They told us to call Jeep Roadside Assistance. We came close to having to spend the night out there in 40 degree weather with no ability to walk out 14 miles in total darkness. The Jeep was towed to the dealer where it remains 7 days later. It has 183 miles on it. Purchased it on May 29 and it broke down on June 2. The failure seemed to be electrical and across the board. It is the 4XE Hybrid, and the internet is littered with stories just like ours of this Jeep failing and stranding people or stopping on freeways or in intersections. We don't think it was ready for market when they introduced it for sale.Had this happened on a freeway it could have been disasterous for us and others around us.",

        "summary": "I have a brand new 2021 Jeep Wrangler 4xe, which is a hybrid and electric vehicle, which gives about 30 miles on a full battery charge. Since the electric mode distance is limited, the car has a hybrid and gas-only mode that runs on gas for when the battery needs a charge after 30 miles. The following problem occurred over 10 times in a 2 day timeframe:   The vehicle gave a dashboard warning that stated \"service charging system\" and \"service transmission\" plus my Jeep app gave a message \"a charge fault has occurred.\" Within 10 seconds, the entire car shut off. At the time, I was going 60 mph on a freeway. This nearly caused a 10-car pile up, but I was fortunately able to get onto the shoulder despite the entire electrical system shutting down. I was lucky, because after 10 seconds, the car came to an immediate stop and I could not move it at all. At the time, I had two-thirds full tank of gas.   I was able to start the engine about 15 minutes later. Shortly thereafter, the same problem occurred again after about 5 minutes of driving. This sequence repeated itself over 10 times until I was able to get towed to a nearby dealership. I was advised that the battery needed to be charged and this problem would not occur. This is an unacceptable explanation, since this vehicle has a gas-only mode to account for the 30 mile electrical battery distance. The following day, I got a full charge, but the problem happened again on the freeway, this time with 20% battery remaining and a one-half tank of gas. I had to get towed for the second time in two days.   This is a very dangerous problem. This car should be recalled. Someone could have died due to the car completely shutting off while on a freeway and coming to a total half after only 10 seconds.   The Jeep 4xe online forum reports 10 separate episodes of the same problem. I have attached a pdf of the formum to prove this is a recurrent issue. I am certain that someone will suffer a fatality from this recurrent problem.",

IT HAS NOT BEEN DRIVEN OFF ROAD AT ALL, AND ONLY ON CITY STREETS, HIGHWAYS, AND INTERSTATES, NO ACCIDENTS.       WHILE DRIVING ON A NEARBY INTERSTATE IN JANUARY OF 2021, AT ABOUT 77 MPH, A MINOR SEAM IN THE ROAD SENT MY VEHICLE INTO WHAT IS COMMONLY KNOWN AS  'DEATH WOBBLE' MODE. HAD ABOUT 4,000 MILES ON THE ODOMETER. ON A FIVE HOUR ROAD TRIP, IT HAPPENED OVER A DOZEN TIMES ON THAT TRIP ALONE.I VIDEOED THE CAR IN VIOLENT WOBBLE AT HIGHWAY SPEED AND RETURNED THE CAR FOR ANOTHER DAY OF SERVICE.       THE LOCAL JEEP SERVICE CENTER ORDERED A 'STEERING DAMPER' ASSEMBLY AS A FIX FOR THE PROBLEM, EVEN THOUGH THE 2021 WRANGLERS COME WITH THAT STEERING DAMPER AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT STARTING THIS YEAR. UNFORTUNATELY, THE PART IS ON AN EXTENDED BACK-ORDER, I AM TOLD, AND WON'T BE AVAILABLE FOR SOME TIME.       IN THE MEANTIME, THEY DID A 'ROAD-FORCE' WHEEL AND TIRE BALANCE AS AN INTERIM FIX. ONE TIRE WAS AT 24 LBS, ONE WAS AT 17 LBS, AND THE OTHER TWO WERE AT 10 LBS AND 1 LBS.       SINCE THEN THE CAR HAS HAD FEWER, MOMENTARY, WOBBLES OF MUCH SHORTER DURATION, AND HAS RECOVERED QUICKLY MORE IT DOES WOBBLE BRIEFLY AT SLOWER SPEEDS NOW AS WELL.       WHILE DRIVING, I CAN FEEL THE SUPPRESSED WOBBLES IN THE STEERING WHEEL AND GAS PEDAL  AND AM CONCERNED FOR SAFETY AND CONTINUED WEAR AND DAMAGE TO FRONT SUSPENSION AND TIRES, AND THE FREQUENCY OF HAVING TO DO COSTLY ROAD FORCE BALANCING ON THE TIRES. I LOVE THE JEEP BUT I'VE LOST CONFIDENCE IN THE CAR AT THIS POINT.       I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO UPLOAD SOME VIDEO OF ONE OF MY CARS DEATH WOBBLES, SHOWING ITS INTENSITY, AND REFUSAL TO SUBSIDE UNTIL DECELERATED TO ABOUT 55 MPH.
