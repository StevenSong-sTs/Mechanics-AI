The Mechanic suggested i call back the 1-800 number to continue with reporting my safety concerns to the manufacturers as there was nothing he could do at the dealership. 2nd call, the new representative also told me to call the dealer and when i asked for a supervisor to report my safety concerns, she hung up on me.

After extensive research I have found many Jeep owners to have this same problem and also found that Chrysler has confirmed it is a built in problem. After taking my Jeep to to dealer and having my keys checked along with the starter and ignition cylinder lock it is the (WCM) wireless control module that is the culprit of the crank but no start issue. This is an extremely unsafe problem due to my vehicle shutting down while driving on top of the other various problems the wcm has caused. Directions say to reset the WCM by pulling the IOD fuse for 30 seconds and then replacing however this method no longer works.",

After getting my 6 year old son safely out of the house I immediately called 911. The fire department arrived and took care of the situation. The entire engine compartment was burnt. Before all of this we arrived at the house and parked in the garage. Only 5 minutes went by between parking the Jeep and calling 911. During operation of the vehicle that day there was no indication of any issues. The Fire Inspector preformed his investigation. As of now I have not received the incident report. Once I do I will supply it. I am waiting to hear from the insurance company regarding when an adjuster will view the Jeep. Thank you.",

I DON'T BELIEVE I HAVE DONE ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY TO CAUSE THIS PROBLEM, I DO BELIEVE THAT JEEP HAS A PROBLEM WITH THIS TRANSMISSION AND IS NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY TO REPAIR THEM.

I AM AFRAID TO PUT MY FAMILY IN THE VEHICLE FOR THAT SAME REASON. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THIS PROBLEM HAS HAPPENED AT LEAST ONCE A DAY IN THE LAST YEAR I HAVE HAD IT, THE DATE OF WHEN IT HAPPENED WAS JUST THE LAST TIME . IF ANYONE IS EVEN LISTENING TO THE OWNERS OR TRYING TO HELP PLEASE LET ME KNOW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.",

I DROVE DOWN A MOUNTAIN PASS AND ON A STRETCH OF 75 MPH INTERSTATE WITHOUT A SWAY AND AN AIR BAG WHICH WAS DANGEROUS. I TOOK IT INTO THE DEALERSHIP TO GET BOTH ISSUES LOOKED AT.

NO PROMISE WAS MADE TO REIMBURSE ME FOR THE DIAGNOSIS AND REPAIR COST SHOULD THE ISSUES BECOME RECALLS SINCE THEY ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION. I TOOK INITIATIVE TO SELF DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE SWAY BAR NOT RECONNECTING SINCE I SUSPECTED THAT THE ELECTRONIC MOTOR WAS STILL FUNCTIONING (I COULD HEAR AND FEEL TO MOTOR OPERATING BEFORE & AFTER I TOOK MY VEHICLE INTO THE DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE). AFTER DISASSEMBLING (NEVER BEEN TAMPERED WITH PRIOR), I FOUND WATER AND RUSTY PARTS INSIDE AND COULD SEE THAT THE UNIT AS POORLY DESIGNED JUDGING FROM THE ONE SMALL SPRING THAT IS SUPPOSE TO WORK TO RE-ENGAGE THE SWAY BAR BY PUSHING THE INTERNAL GEARS (NOW RUSTY) BACK TOGETHER. I SIMPLY APPLIED SOME GREASE TO THE PARTS AND REINSTALLED THE UNIT. TO MY DELIGHT THIS ALLOWED THE MOTOR TO RECONNECT THE SWAY BAR.

THESE LIGHTS CONSTANTLY HOLD WATER AND WE HAVE TO EMPTY THEM REPEATEDLY AND THE WATER NEVER SEEMS TO EMPTY COMPLETELY.  THESE LIGHTS ALSO SEEM TO BE AFFECTED BY WIRING AS THEY DO NOT ALWAYS ILLUMINATE DESPITE AN EFFECTIVE BULB.

THIS IS VERY CONCERNING AS WATER IS AN EXCELLENT CONDUCTOR OF ELECTRICITY.  REGARDLESS OF THE USED CONDITION OF THE CAR I SEE NO REASON WHY THIS SHOULD BE THE CASE AS WIRING SEEMS VERY MUCH LIKE A MANUFACTURE ONLY RESPONSIBILITY.    -WHEELS:  THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED WITH ALL ORIGINAL WHEELS (NOT TIRES) AND THE VALVE STEMS ON EACH WHEEL HAVE DISINTEGRATED COMPLETELY AND CRUMBLED APART.  WE REALIZED THIS WHEN THE LOW AIR LIGHT CAME ON AND WE WENT TO FILL THE TIRES THIS ISSUE SEEMS TO EFFECT HOW WELL THE TIRES CAN HOLD AIR.    -SPEEDOMETER: ORIGINALLY WHEN WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE THE SPEEDOMETER WAS OFF BY ABOUT 10MPH (WE DID NOT KNOW THIS UNTIL DRIVING TWO SEPARATE CARS AND THINKING \"HMM IS THE OTHER DRIVER REALLY SPEEDING THAT MUCH?\"  CALL ONE ANOTHER ON THE PHONE AND DETERMINED THE SUBARU WOULD DRIVE 60MPH AND SEE WHAT SPEED THE JEEP CLAIMED TO BE DRIVING WHEN MATCHED.

I WAS A BIT WORRIED TO DRIVE IT AS I ASSUME THE AIR BAG WILL NOT DEPLOY IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT. HOWEVER I CHOSE TO DRIVE ANYHOW. THE INDICATOR LIGHT WILL GO OFF BUT QUICKLY COMES BACK ON AT AROUND 20-30MPH. FOLLOWED BY A DING EACH TIME IT RETURNS BACK ON. AS IT TURNS OUT, MY MECHANIC SCANNED MY JEEP, BRINGING UP THE CODE OF A FAULTY AIRBAG, CLOCK SPRING. AS A SAFETY ISSUE, I WAS CONCERNED AND CALLED CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPT TO SEE IF A RECALL HAD BEEN ISSUED. UNFORTUNATELY,  NOTHING FOR MY VIN# IS COMING UP. SO THAT MEANS I AM ON MY OWN IN REPAIRING THIS SAFETY ISSUE. MY VEHICLE IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  SO THAT MEANS I AM TO PAY OUT OF POCKET. DEALERSHIP PARTS DEPARTMENT HAS THEM IN STOCK, BUT THEY COST $270 ONLY IN PARTS. NOT INCLUDING LABOR TO INSTALL THE CLOCK SPRING. PLEASE BE AWARE THIS IS A VERY KNOWN ISSUE IN MOST NEWER JEEP JK'S.  I FOLLOW MANY FORUMS FOR MY JEEP.  ALMOST EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM TALK ABOUT THIS KNOWN ISSUE. YET CHRYSLER IS NOT STEPPING UP AND HANDLING THIS IN A SAFE MANNER. I AM THOROUGHLY DISAPPOINTED IN THEM AND UPSET NOW I HAVE NO ACTIVE AIRBAG. TILL I SAVE ENOUGH CASH TO HAVE THIS CLOCK SPRING INSTALLED. :-( PLEASE PRAY NOTHING HAPPENS TO ME AND MY FAMILY. AS IT WILL BE AN EXPENSIVE CHOICE CHRYSLER IS MAKING.  THANKS FOR YOUR TIME..  [XXX]    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",

MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP HAS ADMITTED THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE SEEN MANY JEEP OWNERS WITH THE SAME FAULTY CLOCKSPRING, BUT THEY CHARGE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS TO FIX IT. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THAT FOR EVERY JEEP OWNER THAT TAKES THE TIME TO WRITE A COMPLAINT, THERE MUST BE MANY MORE THAT ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUES WHO NEVER TOOK THE TIME TO WRITE A COMPLAINT. I AM WRITING THIS WITH THE HOPE THAT SOMEONE WILL NOTICE THE LARGE AMOUNT OF  2007+ JEEP WRANGLER OWNERS WHO ARE HAVING THIS SAME ISSUE WITH THE FAULTY CLOCKSPRING, AND INITIATE A RECALL THAT CAN HELP FIX THE CLOCKSPRING AND KEEP PEOPLE SAFE.  *TR",

STOPPED VEHICLE AT HIGHWAY SHOULDER AND THIS CONTINUED EVEN WHEN ENGINE TURNED OFF. DISCONNECTED BATTERY.    WAITED 1 MINUTE, RECONNECTED BATTERY, AND EVERYTHING SEEMED FINE. DROVE ANOTHER 5 MINUTES AND SAME SYMPTOMS STARTED AGAIN AND LASTED UNTIL I REACHED A GAS STATION. POWER WASHER FLUID COMPLETELY DRAINED.    I HAVE BEEN TOLD THIS IS THE TPIM OF THE JEEP WRANGLER CAUSING THIS PROBLEM. NOT SURE IF IT IS LINKED TO A START/STOP CONDITION THE VEHICLE HAS- TURN OVER KEY IN IGNITION AND ALL POWER IS ON BUT ENGINE WILL NOT CRANK. DISENGAGE KEY, TRY AGAIN, SOMETIMES WILL START, SOMETIMES WILL TAKE A THIRD OR FOURTH TIME.    HAVE BROUGHT THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AT IN MARCH 2008. THEY CANNOT DETERMINE A CAUSE.   BROUGHT TO A INDEPENDENT MECHANIC. HE INDICATED THIS WOULD BE A TPIM MALFUNCTION AND SHOULD BE REPLACED.  2007 JEEP WRANGLERS HAD A RECALL FOR THE TPIM FAILURE. I SEE THERE IS LITIGATION ONGOING FOR OTHER CHRYSLER PRODUCTS WITH TPIM ISSUES. 2008 JEEP WRANGLERS APPEAR TO HAVE FAR AND AWAY MORE ISSUES THAN OTHER NEW JK JEEP WRANGLERS...  *TR",

THE DEATH WOBBLE JUST STARTED ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO WHEN APPLYING BRAKES OVER 55 MPH. MOSTLY FRONT-END WOBBLE. IT HAPPENED SPORADICALLY AND ONLY AT SPEEDS AROUND 60 MPH.  I TOOK IT TO MY MECHANIC AND HE REPLACED THE ROTORS. JUST A FEW DAYS LATER, THE WOBBLE RETURNED, BUT MUCH WORSE, AND WITH NO BRAKING APPLIED.  THE WHOLE CAR VIOLENTLY SHOOK.  I RETURNED THE VEHICLE BACK TO MY MECHANIC. HE DID SOME RESEARCH AND EVENTUALLY INSTALLED A NEW STEERING DAMPER, A BIGGER ONE THAN THE ORIGINAL PART. I AM HOPEFUL THE PROBLEM WILL BE FIXED.  IN RESEARCHING THIS MATTER AND REVIEWING THE VARIOUS BLOGS, INCLUDING THIS SITE, I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT CHRYSLER JEEP IS NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  WHILE THERE HAS BEEN NO REPORTS OF DEATH, THAT IS JUST FORTUITOUS.  SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT IT.  NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT SO MANY OPERATORS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE SAME MODEL.  *TR",

WHERE I LIVE IN A DESERT REGION OF WYOMING THE DIRT ROADS ARE USUALLY COVERED IN FLOUR LIKE DUST SO DIRT GETS EVERYWHERE.  I SUSPECT THE REAL REASON FOR ALLOWING CHRYSLER OFF THE HOOK IS THE COST INVOLVED TO WARRANTY THE REST OF THE VEHICLES.  IF THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM IS A DESIGN DEFECT THEN ALL OF THOSE VEHICLES WHO ACTUALLY HAVE THE PROBLEM NEED THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.  IF LEFT HAND DRIVE VEHICLES DON?T HAVE THE PROBLEM THEN PEOPLE WON?T BE ASKING FOR REPAIR.    IT COST AROUND $500 FOR THIS REPAIR WHICH MANY PEOPLE MAY NEGLECT CAUSING THEIR DEATH.  WHY ARE MAIL CARRIER LIVES MORE VALUABLE THAN THE REST OF US?    PLEASE RECONSIDER THE DECISION TO DISREGARD THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF THE MAJORITY OF JEEP OWNERS WHO HAVE LEFT HAND DRIVE VEHICLES AT LEAST IN THIS COUNTRY.  I SUSPECT THE DEFECTIVE PART IS DEFECTIVE NO MATTER WHAT SIDE OF THE VEHICLE IT IS INSTALLED ON.  *TR",

JUST GOT MY VEHICLE OUT OF THE SHOP, LEITH CHRYSLER JEEP $2,374.43 I PAID.  AFTER 245 MILES (FROM RALEIGH TO WASHINGTON, DC), THE VIOLENT VIBRATIONS/SHAKING STARTED AGAIN.  CALL THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY ADVISED ME TO TAKE JEEP TO LOCAL CHRYSLER JEEP DEALERSHIP, WARRANTY ON THE REPAIRS 12,000 MILES TO 24 MONTHS.  TOOK THE JEEP TO DARCARS MARLOW HEIGHTS, THEY WOULD NOT ACCEPT THE OTHER CHRYSLER JEEP DEALERS REPAIRS BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY USED AFTERMARKET PARTS.  I CALLED THE CHRYSLER CORPORATE OFFICE AND FILED A COMPLAINT (CASE # 23448465) WHICH WAS USELESS, THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT MAKE ANOTHER CHRYSLER FRANCHISE WARRANTY THE REPAIRS (THE CORPORATE OFFICE WAS USELESS).  I PAID AND ADDITIONAL $270.00 WHICH LEITH COMPLAINED TO THE DEALERSHIP WANTING TO KNOW WHY THEY CHARGED SO MUCH AFTER THEY UPS??ED THE REPLACEMENT PART TO THEM.  AFTER PAYING THE MONEY AND GETTING JEEP BACK.  I DROVE BACK TO RALEIGH, DROVE OVER THE HIGHWAY DIVIDER ON THE EXIT TO GET ON I40 AND THE VIBRATION STARTED AGAIN.  THIS CAN NOT CONTINUE TO GO ON!!!  AN INVESTIGATION NEEDS TO BE DONE TO OFFICIALLY PROVE THAT THIS ??DEATH WOBBLE??

WE CALLED THE DEALER AND FOUND THAT IT IS COVERED UNDER AN UNLIMITED MILES UNLIMITED MONTHS EXTENDED WARRANTY.  GLAD WE CALLED BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GET ANY NOTICE OF THIS EXTENDED COVERAGE IN THE MAIL.  A SEPARATE ISSUE BEGAN IN 2012 WITH SOME LEAKAGE OF GAS UNDER THE VEHICLE AND AN ODOR OF GAS OUTSIDE THE CAR IF THE TANK WAS FILLED UP ALL THE WAY.  SINCE THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED, OUR PERSONAL MECHANIC HANDLED IT.  HE REPLACED A HOSE THAT WAS ATTACHED TO THE FUEL TANK (THE SAME GAS CAP SENSOR LIGHT WAS ON FOR THIS PROBLEM TOO).  HE ALSO TIGHTENED THE FUEL PUMP AT THE TANK WHERE THE GAS WAS LEAKING FROM AND HE FOUND A CRACK IN THE TANK WHICH HE PATCHED.  THIS FIXED THE ODOR AND LEAKING OF GAS FROM UNDER THE JEEP. IF THIS PROBLEM HAPPENS AGAIN IN THE FUTURE, NOW KNOWING ABOUT THE EXTENDED WARRANTY WITH THE OTHER PROBLEM, WE WILL CONTACT THE DEALER ABOUT IT TO SEE IF IT IS COVERED TOO AS IT IS GAS TANK RELATED.

THE DEALER FIXED THE PROBLEM (UNDER WARRANTY) BY REPLACING THE STEERING COLUMN SHOCK (OR SOMETHING).

OF COURSE, AT 57000 MILES, IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY AND I HAD TO PAY THE $230 FOR THE REPAIR.

NEITHER DEALER NOR MANUFACTURER EVER MENTIONED THIS TSB  DURING THE 2013 REPAIR. WHEN I PICKED IT UP, IT WAS NOT FIXED. JEEP CO.

ON ONE OCCASION, THE VEHICLE SHOOK SO VIOLENTLY THAT IT TOOK THE STEERING WHEEL OUT OF MY WIFE'S HANDS.  SHE WAS GOING AROUND 55 MPH AROUND A CURVE.  ON A SECOND OCCASION, I WAS SLOWING DOWN TO TAKE AN EXIT RAMP.  SLOWING FROM 75 MPH TO AROUND 60 MPH AND ENTERING THE EXIT RAMP CURVE, THE STEERING WHEEL WAS ALMOST SHAKEN OUT OF MY HANDS.  ON A THIRD OCCASION, AT AROUND 60 MPH ON A STRAIGHT ROAD WITH NO BUMPS, THE JEEP BEGAN TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY AND AGAIN PULLED THE STEERING WHEEL OUT OF ANOTHER DRIVERS HANDS.  THE MINOR VIBRATION HAPPENS EVERYDAY BETWEEN 55-60 MPH.  THE DEALERSHIP SAYS NOTHING IS WRONG.  I HAVE REPLACED THE STEERING STABILIZER WITH A RANCHO HEAVY DUTY STABILIZER.  VIBRATION WENT AWAY FOR ABOUT 500 MILES.  I RELIGIOUSLY DO A 5 TIRE ROTATION AND BALANCE.  NO CHANGE.  I HAVE HAD A 4 WHEEL ALIGNMENT COMPLETED.  NO CHANGE.  JEEP WILL NOT DRIVE THE VEHICLE.  THEY SAY IF THERE IS A VIBRATION TO HAVE THE TIRES BALANCED AND THE FRONT END ALIGNED.  WHEN I TELL THEM THAT HAS BEEN DONE, THEIR REPLY IS THAT IT WAS NOT COMPLETED PROPERLY AND THEY WOULD DO IT FOR $300.  I AM GETTING TO THE POINT OF SELLING OR TRADING IT IN SINCE I CANNOT FIX THE ISSUE.  I AM ALMOST READY TO TRY TO REPLACE BALL JOINTS, BUT AT 47,700 MILES AND NO SUSPENSION OR ENGINE MODIFICATIONS.  THE JEEP HAS NEVER BEEN OFF-ROADED, NEVER BEEN MISTREATED.  WHAT NOW?  JEEP ALSO OFFERED TO REPLACE THE BALL JOINTS, PITMAN ARM, TIE ROD ENDS, SWAY BAR END LINKS, ETC. FOR A NICE SUM OF THE $2500.

(I WAS PASSING THROUGH THE TOWN OF ORCHARD PARK ON HIGHWAY 20A.  I THOUGHT IT STRANGE BUT KNEW IT WAS VERY SENSITIVE TO EVEN A SLIGHT CHANGE IN PRESSURE.)  I PROCEEDED TO ENTER THE 219, INCREASING  SPEED TO 60 MPH, WHEN I SUDDENLY REALIZED I HAD LOST ALL PRESSURE IN MY RIGHT REAR TIRE.  I MANAGED TO SAFELY EXIT THE HIGHWAY AND TO CALL MY HUSBAND TO CHANGE THE TIRE.  WHILE DOING SO, HE NOTICED THE ENTIRE VALVE STEM WAS MISSING.  THERE WAS JUST A HOLE WHERE IT HAD BEEN.  HE ASSUMED THAT THE NUT THAT HOLDS THE TPMS HAD WORKED ITS WAY LOOSE AND THAT IT WAS INSIDE THE TIRE.  HE TOOK THE TIRE TO WEST-HERR CHRYSLER JEEP AND THEY REINSERTED THE TPMS AND REPLACED THE MOUNTING NUT.  ABOUT A YEAR LATER, THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN - INSTANT DEFLATION - WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON I-190 (ABOUT 50 MILES/HOUR), ONLY THIS TIME IT WAS MY LEFT REAR TIRE.  AGAIN, I MANAGED TO EXIT  SAFELY AND  TO AGAIN CALL MY HUSBAND.  THIS TIME HE COULDN'T GET THE TIRE OFF THE HUB SO WE CALLED AAA.  WHILE WAITING FOR THEM, A FELLOW JEEP OWNER STOPPED TO RENDER ASSISTANCE AND HE POINTED OUT THAT THE NUT HOLD THE TPMS ON THE LEFT FRONT TIRE WAS CORRODED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED ALSO.  (MY HUSBAND WHO HAS A PH.D. IN CHEMISTRY FROM INDIANA U. NOTICED THAT MOST OF THE VALVE STEM IS ALUMINUM AND IT IS IN CONTACT WITH THE STEEL WHEEL.  HE POSTULATED THAT THE TWO UNLIKE METALS ACTED AS A CELL AND WITH THE SALT THAT IS USED ON THE ROADS HERE THAT LED TO VERY RAPID CORROSION.)

I AM ONLY USING 87 OCTANE GAS AS PER THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL AND THIS HAPPENS AT EVERY GAS STATION (MOBIL, SHELL, SUNOCO, TEXACO, GLOBAL, IRVING, CITGO, ETC.)  MY LOCAL GAS STATIONS ARE SICK OF ME COMING IN BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO PUT OUT KITTY LITTER TO MOP UP THE MESS.  *TR",

THE CONSUMER RETURNED TO THE REPAIR SHOP WHERE THEY REPLACED THE STEERING DAMPER, WHICH SEEMED TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM FOR AWHILE. IN JULY, THE CONSUMER TOOK THE VEHICLE FOR A ROUTINE MAINTENANCE CHECK. WHILE CHECKING THE FRONT END, THE MECHANIC WAS ABLE TO GET TWO FULL TURNS ON A NUT ON THE TRACK BAR.

SO I DID AN INTERNET SEARCH AND DISCOVERED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM AND THAT THE MANUFACTURER HAD ISSUED A RECALL FOR 2007 AND 2008 WRANGLERS MANUFACTURED BETWEEN MARCH 2007-MARCH 2008. I CHECKED MY VEHICLE AND DETERMINED IT WAS MANUFACTURED IN MAY 2008. HOWEVER THE PROBLEM WAS THE IDENTICAL PROBLEM COMPLAINED ABOUT AND WHICH WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE RECALL.  I THEREFORE CONTACTED MY DEALER AND WAS EVENTUALLY ADVISED THAT THEY WOULD REPLACE THE FUEL TANK AS AN EMISSION PROBLEM COVERED BY A LIFETIME WARRANTY.  I WOULD CERTAINLY THINK IT ADVISABLE FOR THE MANUFACTURER BE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY ITS OWNERS OF THIS PROBLEM AND/OR ISSUE A RECALL OF THE AFFECTED VEHICLES. PLEASE NOTE THAT ISSUES RELATING TO VEHICLE DEFECTS AND RECALLS IS NOT PART OF MY PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE AND I HAVE NO INTEREST IN THIS MATTER OTHER THAN BEING A SINGLE JEEP OWNER.  *TR",

THERE IS A CURRENT RECALL FOR RIGHT HAND DRIVE JEEPS FOR THE SAME PROBLEM BUT CHRYSLER WILL NOT HONOR THAT FOR THE LEFT HAND DRIVE JEEPS. I HAVE TRIED TALKING TO MY DEALER, AND CHRYSLER DIRECT WITH NO LUCK. I AM CONFUSED AS TO HOW THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH REFUSING TO FIX A KNOWN SAFETY PROBLEM, NOT TO MENTION MORALLY. I KNOW THEY ARE A CORPORATION AND MORALS ARE NOT HIGH ON THEIR PRIORITIES, HOWEVER SELLING MORE OF THEIR PRODUCT SHOULD BE. I LOVE MY JEEP, AND PLANNED ON GIVING THIS ONE TO MY SON IN A FEW YEARS WHEN HE IS OLD ENOUGH TO DRIVE AND BUYING A NEW ONE FOR MYSELF. NOT SO SURE I WANT TO BUY ANOTHER VEHICLE FROM A MANUFACTURE WHO WONT STAND BEHIND A SAFETY ISSUE. IF THIS WAS AN ISSUE OVER SOMETHING LIKE A RADIO OR OTHER \"LUXURY\" I WOULD HAVE NO ISSUE. BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE. THERE IS A COMMON SAFETY ISSUE AND THEY REFUSE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND MAKE IT RIGHT. I HAVE ALWAYS DRIVEN TOYOTA'S AND NEVER HAD ANY ISSUES WITH THEM STANDING BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS.

I TOOK IT TO THE SEALER THAT AFTERNOON AND THEY SUSPECT THE TIPM NEEDS REPLACING BUT THERE ARE 178 ON BACK ORDER.

I HAD PEOPLE PULLING OVER OUT OF MY WAY BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT I WAS HONKING AT THEM.  I HAVE SINCE UNPLUGGED THE HORN AND SEE THIS AS A HAZARD.  IT WAS DARK AND SPRAYING WASHER FLUID INTERMITTENTLY FOR 3 OR SO MINUTES WAS VERY DISTRACTING AND KEEP INTERFERING WITH MY VISIBILITY.  TODAY MY DOOR LOCKS KEEP CLICKING AS I DRIVE.

ONLY FIX IS TO NOT COMPLETELY FILL TANK BUT YOU HAVE TO GUESS EACH TIME HOW CLOSE TO FULL THE TANK IS. GAS SPILLED OUT BETWEEN 1/10 AND 1/2 GAL EACH TIME -HARD TO MEASURE. *TR",

AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS, THERE WAS NO RESPONSE AT ALL TO TURNING THE KEY IN THE IGNITION.  THE CAR WAS COMPLETELY INOPERABLE.  THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME THIS HAD HAPPENED.  I WAS ACTUALLY JUST A MILE DOWN THE ROAD FROM JUST PICKING UP MY JEEP FROM THE DEALERSHIP WHERE IT HAD BEEN SERVICED FOR THE PAST 8 DAYS FOR THE EXACT SAME ISSUE.  I HAD LITERALLY JUST PICKED UP THE VEHICLE AFTER BEING TOLD THAT THE ISSUE WAS FINALLY RESOLVED.  THE ACTUAL RECEIPT FROM THE SERVICE SHOP SHOWS THAT 0.2 HOURS WERE SPENT ON FIXING THE ISSUE WHICH INVOLVED THE WCM MODULE.  THE 8 DAYS WHERE IT SAT AT THE DEALERSHIP CONSISTED OF 2 DAYS OF NO DIAGNOSIS, ESSENTIALLY JUST SITTING AT THE DEALERSHIP; 1 DAY WHEN THE WCM MODULE WAS ORDERED AFTER DIAGNOSIS; AND THE REST OF THE TIME SPENT WAITING FOR THE PART TO ARRIVE AND PLACED ON THE CAR.  THE FIRST STALL OCCURRED IN MY DRIVEWAY WITH MY DAUGHTER AND HER FRIENDS IN THE VEHICLE.  I WAS ABLE TO JUST MOVE THE KIDS INTO THE HOUSE WITH NO REAL SAFETY INCIDENT.  HOWEVER, THIS SECOND INCIDENT LED TO ME ROLLING INTO PARKING LOT TRAFFIC AND TOWARDS THE RESTAURANT SIDEWALK AND BUILDING.  THE PARKING SPACE WAS AT AN INCLINE WHICH ALLOWED THE STALLED OUT CAR TO GAIN MOMENTUM AS IT ROLLED BACKWARD.  FORTUNATELY SINCE THIS WAS THE SECOND INCIDENT I QUICKLY REALIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND IMMEDIATELY PULLED THE PARKING BRAKE.  HOWEVER I DID WIND UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARKING LOT BLOCKING TRAFFIC IN AND OUT OF THE LOT.  *TR",
