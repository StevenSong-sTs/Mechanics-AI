Due to a software error, the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) may fail to learn the locations of the individual sensors while the vehicle is being driven.  As a result, the low tire pressure warning light will illuminate, despite the the tire pressures being within specification.  Should one of the tires lose air pressure, the driver would not be notified of the change in air pressure.  As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 138, \"Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems.\"",
        "Consequence": "If the TPMS light illuminates because the sensors cannot be located, it could mask an actual low tire pressure condition, possibly resulting in tire failure, increasing the risk of a crash.",
        "Remedy": "Chrysler has notified owners, and dealers will reprogram the TPMS module, free of charge.  The recall began on October 23, 2014.  Owners may contact Chrysler customer service at 1-800-853-1403. Chrysler's number for this recall is P63.",
